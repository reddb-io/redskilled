# 0026 — AFK exposes lifecycle hooks as shell interceptors

## Status

accepted.

`/afk` already runs project-specific shell scripts at a few baked-in points
(e.g. the cargo/gradle isolation defaults under `afk.hooks.defaults` in
`.red/config.yaml`). Those are hardcoded behaviours owned by the AFK code,
not extension points users can author. Today there is no supported way for a
project to say "before the loop starts, do X", "filter the queue to only
issues I created", "after every worker, clear cargo's incremental cache", or
"if the worker crashes, ping my pager".

We need a stable, project-local extension surface that covers the AFK
lifecycle without forcing every customisation back into the skill itself.

## Decision

`/afk` will expose a fixed set of **lifecycle hooks** declared in
`.red/config.yaml` (under `afk.hooks`) and resolved as ordered lists of
shell commands. Every hook follows a single **interceptor contract**: it
receives the current AFK context and may optionally return a modified
context, in the spirit of an axios request/response interceptor.

### Hook points

The AFK lifecycle exposes the following hooks, in execution order:

| Hook                | When it fires                                                | Mutable input            |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `pre_session`       | Boot, before any queue work                                  | session config           |
| `pre_pick`          | Before listing the issue tracker queue                       | query params             |
| `post_pick`         | After listing, before claiming                               | issues[]                 |
| `pre_worktree`      | Before the per-issue worktree is created                     | issue, target path       |
| `pre_attempt`       | Before each runner invocation on this issue (fires once per attempt — re-fires on runner-fallback swap) | issue, workspace, attempt_n |
| `post_attempt`      | Runner returned (success **or** clean failure) for this attempt | issue, workspace, result, attempt_n |
| `pre_merge`         | Before merging worker branch into the pinned branch          | issue, workspace, diff   |
| `post_merge`        | After successful merge                                       | issue, merge commit      |
| `on_attempt_error`  | Unhandled exception inside this attempt's runner             | issue, workspace, error, attempt_n |
| `on_idle`           | Queue drained, before sleep/exit                             | session stats            |
| `post_session`      | Normal session termination                                   | session stats            |
| `on_session_error`  | Unhandled exception in the loop itself (last gasp)           | error                    |

`on_idle` is intentionally separate from `post_session` so projects can run
"between drains" maintenance (e.g. `cargo clean`, prune stale worktrees,
`docker system prune`) without that cost being paid per-attempt inside
`post_attempt`.

ADR 0045 extends this model with one **periodic** hook, `on_heartbeat`, fired
from the attempt guard's cadence while an attempt is still running. It is
distinct from the once-per-lifecycle-moment interceptors above: it may fire
many times in one attempt, carries heartbeat/progress context, and has a
`continue` exit policy so a failing heartbeat hook cannot abort the run.

### Worker vs attempt vocabulary

The lifecycle uses two distinct terms that earlier drafts conflated:

- **worker** = the AFK orchestrator process draining the queue (identified
  by `RED_AFK_WORKER_ID`, e.g. `wNHSY`). One worker processes many issues
  over its lifetime, one issue at a time.
- **attempt** = one execution of the inner agent on one issue, as defined
  by ADR 0017 ("the audit object for one execution"). Under
  `--fallback-runner`, a single issue can produce **multiple attempts** —
  e.g. claude exhausts mid-issue, codex picks up the same worktree as
  attempt 2.

The `pre_attempt` / `post_attempt` / `on_attempt_error` hooks fire **per
runner invocation**, not per issue. A `--fallback-runner` swap on issue
#42 produces two `pre_attempt` → `post_attempt` cycles, with `attempt_n`
incrementing (1 for the first, 2 for the swap). Each cycle carries the
runner identity in `RED_AFK_RUNNER` so hooks can branch on it.

This alignment matters because the Memory plugin's `attempt` node (ADR
0017) already records one node per runner invocation; binding the hook
boundary to the same semantic means the `attempt.hooks` summary field
introduced by #216 maps 1:1 — every attempt node corresponds to exactly
one `pre_attempt → post_attempt` cycle, and every hook firing has a
sibling attempt node to attach to.

"Session-level" framing for the worker process lives in `pre_session` /
`post_session` / `on_session_error`. "Issue-level" framing lives between
`pre_worktree` (worktree created) and `pre_merge` (about to integrate).
"Attempt-level" framing lives between `pre_attempt` and `post_attempt`,
and can repeat within one issue. Hooks that want "fire exactly once per
issue regardless of fallback" should use `pre_worktree` or `pre_merge`,
not `pre_attempt`.

### Interceptor contract

Every hook command runs with:

- **Env vars** for the common fields (`RED_AFK_ISSUE_ID`,
  `RED_AFK_WORKSPACE`, `RED_AFK_RESULT_STATUS`, etc.). Shell-friendly so
  trivial hooks (`bash ./.red/hooks/notify.sh`) do not need to parse JSON.
- **Full context JSON on stdin** for hooks that want to inspect or mutate
  structured fields.

The command may:

- Write **nothing to stdout** → AFK keeps the original context unchanged
  (pure side-effect hook).
- Write a **JSON object to stdout** → AFK replaces the relevant slice of
  context with the returned value. Only the fields documented as mutable
  for that hook (see table above) are honoured; AFK ignores extra keys.

Exit codes:

- `0` → continue.
- non-zero → abort *this step* with hook-specific semantics:
  - `pre_session`, `pre_pick`, `pre_worktree`, `pre_merge`: abort the
    session / pick / worktree / merge.
  - `pre_attempt`: skip this issue, continue the loop.
  - `post_attempt`, `post_merge`, `post_pick`, `on_idle`, `post_session`,
    `on_attempt_error`, `on_session_error`: log the failure and continue —
    a broken notifier must never wedge `/afk`.

Multiple commands per hook run sequentially in declaration order; each one
sees the context as mutated by the previous one. A failed earlier command
short-circuits later ones in the same hook list.

### Config shape

```yaml
afk:
  hooks:
    pre_session:
      - "bash ./.red/hooks/boot.sh"
    pre_pick:
      - "bash ./.red/hooks/only-mine.sh"      # may emit {"labels":["mine"]}
    post_pick:
      - "bash ./.red/hooks/dedupe.sh"         # may emit filtered issues[]
    post_attempt:
      - "bash ./.red/hooks/notify.sh"
    on_attempt_error:
      - "bash ./.red/hooks/page-oncall.sh"
    on_idle:
      - "cargo clean -p reddb-storage"        # the canonical example
    post_session:
      - "bash ./.red/hooks/summarize.sh"
```

A bare string is accepted as shorthand for a single-element list. Unknown
hook names are a config error (caught at session boot, surfaced through
`on_session_error` if it fires after boot).

## Why

- **One mental model instead of two.** Earlier drafts split this into
  observer "hooks" and transforming "filters". Modelling everything as an
  interceptor (input in, optional input out) removes that split: trivial
  notifiers ignore stdin/stdout, sophisticated ones mutate context. Same
  config shape, same execution model, same failure semantics.
- **Lifecycle coverage matches real automation needs.** Pre/post pairs for
  the session, queue pick, worktree, worker, and merge let projects bolt
  on boot, filtering, environment seeding, notification, and post-merge
  validation without forking the skill.
- **`on_idle` separates "between drains" maintenance from per-issue
  teardown.** The cargo example is the giveaway: `cargo clean` per
  `post_attempt` would defeat incremental compilation; `cargo clean` at
  `on_idle` runs exactly when the cache is no longer load-bearing.
- **Errors are first-class without conflating outcomes.** `post_attempt`
  always runs for "the worker terminated normally" (success or clean
  failure). `on_attempt_error` exists for "the worker itself blew up", and
  `on_session_error` exists for "the loop blew up". Hook authors do not
  have to demultiplex on `result.status`.
- **Env vars for the common case, JSON for the rich case.** Asking every
  shell author to `jq` just to read an issue ID would be hostile to the
  90% of hooks that are one-line side effects.
- **Stays inside `.red/config.yaml`.** No new config file, no new
  discovery rules; consistent with the existing `afk.fleet.*` and
  `afk.hooks.defaults.*` keys (the latter now becomes one specific case
  of the broader hook surface).

### Internal hook adoption

The dispatcher is not only an extension surface for users — large parts of
the current `afk.sh` flow are themselves "policy" that should live on the
same pipeline. The migration splits AFK's existing behaviour into two
buckets along a single rule:

> **If the failure of a step must abort the session loudly and visibly,
> it is mechanism. If "log and continue" is an acceptable failure mode,
> it is a hook.**

**Migrates to built-in hooks** (registered by AFK at the relevant
lifecycle point, run through the same dispatcher as user hooks):

- `detectors/cargo.sh`, `detectors/gradle.sh` → `pre_worktree`
- `.env` / symlink seeding into the worktree → `pre_worktree`
- Heartbeat tick and intermediate envelope updates → `post_attempt`
- Post-merge CI / smoke validation → `post_merge`
- Task Mirror sync to the tracker → `post_pick`, `post_attempt`
- Session summary notification → `post_session`

**Stays as mechanism** (lifecycle steps themselves, not entries in any
hook list — they happen *between* the surrounding pre/post hooks):

- Atomic issue claim on the tracker (race-sensitive, transactional)
- Worktree creation itself (`pre_worktree` decorates, it does not create)
- Supervisor heartbeat and stall reaper (ADR 0015 safety invariant)
- Branch lock enforcement (ADR 0006)
- Merge into the pinned branch (ADR 0008)
- Conflict resolution path
- Post-merge worktree teardown
- Terminal Envelope post and issue close

A user disabling `afk.hooks.defaults.cargo` removes the built-in cargo
hook from the `pre_worktree` list — it does not skip the worktree
creation step itself, because that one is mechanism.

### Execution order

Each lifecycle moment is structured as `pre_<step>` → **mechanism step**
→ `post_<step>`. The mechanism step is owned by AFK and never appears
in a hook list; it is the irreducible work the orchestrator must do.
Hooks decorate it.

Within a single hook list, commands run in this order:

1. **Built-in defaults**, in the order AFK registers them.
2. **User hooks** from `.red/config.yaml`, in declaration order.

Both layers participate in the interceptor chain: each command sees the
context as mutated by every previous command in the list, defaults and
user alike. The rule generalises across `pre_*` and `post_*`:

- For `pre_*`: defaults set up the environment (cargo isolation, env
  seeding), then user hooks extend or override on top before mechanism
  runs.
- For `post_*`: defaults reconcile AFK-owned state (mirror sync, envelope
  update), then user hooks fire with the already-reconciled context
  (notify Slack with the real merge commit, page on validation failure).

Worked example for one cycle around merge:

```
pre_merge defaults  (e.g. "ensure clean index")     ── interceptor chain
pre_merge user      (e.g. "block if diff > 5k LOC") ──┘
─────── mechanism: merge + conflict resolution ───────  (not a hook)
post_merge defaults (validation, mirror update)     ── interceptor chain
post_merge user     (e.g. "Slack the merge URL")    ──┘
─────── mechanism: worktree teardown, envelope post ─  (not a hook)
```

Users can **disable** any specific built-in default via
`afk.hooks.defaults.<name>: false`, but cannot reorder defaults among
themselves or interleave with them — defaults are owned by the skill and
their relative order encodes correctness invariants (e.g. cargo
isolation must seed `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` before any user `pre_worktree`
hook tries to read it). A user who needs a hook to run *before* the
defaults should propose promoting it into the defaults set rather than
reaching under the hood.

## Rejected alternatives

- **Two separate concepts, `hooks:` and `filters:`.** Initially proposed.
  Rejected after the user pushed back: an axios-style interceptor model
  collapses the two cleanly and avoids forcing trivial hooks to learn a
  JSON-stdin contract.
- **Hook scripts as a directory convention (`./.red/hooks/pre_session.sh`,
  etc.).** Rejected because it implies one script per hook, conflicts
  with the "list of commands" model, and complicates conditional inclusion
  (env-gated hooks, per-runner hooks).
- **Hooks as a separate `.red/afk/hooks.yaml`.** Rejected for the first
  slice to keep configuration discovery cheap; can be split later if the
  block grows unwieldy.
- **Keep the names `pre_worker` / `post_worker` / `on_worker_error`.**
  Rejected because "worker" already names the AFK orchestrator process
  (`RED_AFK_WORKER_ID`), and ADR 0017 already established "attempt" as
  the canonical domain term for one runner invocation. Co-opting "worker"
  for hook events meant the same word carried two unrelated meanings,
  which confused readers and broke recall queries grounded in ADR 0017
  vocabulary. The hooks fire per runner invocation, so `pre_attempt` /
  `post_attempt` / `on_attempt_error` matches both the existing graph
  schema and the actual firing cadence.
- **Rename without changing semantics ("Leitura A" — same one-shot
  per-issue firing, just renamed).** Rejected because that retains the
  semantic mismatch with `--fallback-runner`. Under fallback, one issue
  produces two runner invocations; a hook that only fires once cannot
  observe the swap or differentiate the runner that crashed from the
  runner that recovered. Per-attempt firing aligns with both ADR 0017's
  one-node-per-execution rule and the operator intuition that a fallback
  retry is a "fresh attempt".
- **Merge `on_attempt_error` into `post_attempt` with a status field.**
  Rejected because crash paths and clean-failure paths have different
  invariants (workspace may be half-populated, branch may not exist) and
  conflating them would force every hook author to defensively branch on
  status.
- **Treat `on_idle` as equivalent to `post_session`.** Rejected for the
  cargo/cache case above: idle and termination are different lifecycle
  moments and projects need to script them independently.
- **Stop on first non-zero exit for every hook.** Rejected for post/idle
  hooks because a broken notifier or a failing cache cleanup must not
  wedge AFK; only pre-hooks abort their step.
- **Treat the existing `afk.sh` actions as opaque mechanism and only
  expose hooks around the outside.** Rejected because today's
  `detectors/cargo.sh`, `detectors/gradle.sh`, mirror sync, and
  post-merge validation are already policy in disguise: they are
  per-project choices, fail-soft, and have no global safety invariant.
  Keeping them as ad-hoc shell inside the orchestrator while exposing
  a parallel hook surface would leave AFK with two execution models
  for the same kind of action.
- **Let user hooks reorder or replace built-in defaults arbitrarily.**
  Rejected because some defaults encode correctness invariants
  (cargo isolation must run before any user `pre_worktree` hook that
  reads `CARGO_TARGET_DIR`). Disable-via-config is supported; reorder
  is not — a user who needs that should propose promoting their hook
  into the defaults bundle.

## Consequences

- `/afk` gains a hook dispatcher with the interceptor contract above,
  invoked at each lifecycle point. The dispatcher owns env-var
  population, JSON serialisation on stdin, JSON parsing on stdout,
  exit-code routing, and per-hook failure semantics.
- The existing `afk.hooks.defaults` keys (`cargo`, `gradle`, …) keep
  working and are reframed as built-in hook contributors layered on top
  of the user-declared hooks; user hooks run after defaults at the same
  lifecycle point.
- AFK Envelopes should record which user hooks ran at terminal time
  (names and exit codes), so attempt history reflects external mutations
  to the queue or worker context. Hook stdout/stderr stays local-only by
  default; pushing it into the Envelope is a later slice.
- The Memory `attempt` node (ADR 0017) gains an optional `hooks` summary
  field once Envelope capture lands, so reasoning recall can surface
  "this attempt ran with `only-mine` filter".
- Documentation: the `/afk` skill README and `.red/config.yaml` template
  must enumerate the hook list, env vars, mutable fields, and exit-code
  semantics. A short example hook (`only-mine.sh`) ships under
  `plugins/dev/skills/productivity/afk/examples/`.
- Codex parity: because hooks are plain shell, no Codex-specific bridge
  is required, sidestepping the PreCompact gap noted for the memory
  plugin.
- `scripts/hooks.sh` and `detectors/*.sh` get refactored behind the new
  dispatcher: same shell scripts, registered as built-in defaults at
  their lifecycle point instead of being called inline from `afk.sh`.
  The existing `tests/hooks-orchestrator.test.sh` harness covers
  defaults and user hooks under one execution model.
- The reordering ban is documented in the `/afk` skill README: users
  disable defaults, they do not reorder them; promotion of a user
  hook into the defaults bundle is the supported path when ordering
  must change.
