## Context

The red ecosystem has a dedicated repo per product:

- `reddb` — the embedded multi-model engine.
- `red-memory` — the local-first graph+markdown memory plugin for Claude Code, backed by RedDB (`packages/mcp-server/`, hooks, CLI). Currently **pre-alpha**.
- `red-ui` — the universal RedDB client, one Svelte source shipped three ways: embeddable web component (`@reddb-io/ui/embed`), an MCP *App* server (`@reddb-io/ui-mcp`, renders the client inside an MCP host), and a Tauri desktop app.

red-skills historically **built** the memory plugin under `apps/memory` (mature, ~55k lines) and exposed it as the `memory` MCP — even though `red-memory` is the dedicated home. The mature implementation lived here; the dedicated repo was the empty shell. Separately, the memory MCP name was inconsistent across three surfaces (`memory` registered, but the routing-guide advertised `reddb-memory` + `command: memory-mcp` + `MEMORY_ROOT`, a command/env that does not match the real bootstrap invocation).

There are two distinct MCPs in play, repeatedly conflated:

- a **data** MCP — the memory tools (`memory_recall`, `memory_store`, `memory_search`, traverse/neighbors/path, sessions, supersede, export, …); it connects to the embedded RedDB **and** serves the tools (one server, not two).
- a **visualizer** MCP — red-ui's `ui-mcp` (MCP App) that renders the red-ui client over the same RedDB so a human can *see* the memory graph.

## Decision

1. **red-skills is a consumer, not the home, of memory and UI.** The mature `apps/memory` **migrates to the `red-memory` repo** (its canonical home), which becomes the source of the memory plugin/MCP. `apps/memory` is retired from red-skills after the migration lands.

2. **Canonical MCP names align with their owning repo:**
   - **`red-memory`** — the data/tools MCP (was `memory` / the never-settled `reddb-memory`). Tools keep the `memory_*` prefix; only the server name changes.
   - **`red-ui`** — the visualizer MCP App (was `ui-mcp` / `@reddb-io/ui-mcp`).
   - **`code-nav`** — unchanged; stays built in red-skills under the `dev` plugin. The brand-prefix asymmetry (`code-nav` not `red-code-nav`) is accepted.

3. **red-skills pulls both as bundles from their repos' GitHub releases** (the fetch model of ADR 0029) — one fetch mechanism across the ecosystem, no npm-registry runtime dependency. **Both MCPs live in the memory plugin's `.mcp.json`** — `red-memory` (data) *and* `red-ui` (visualizer) — as consumers; red-skills builds neither. This replaces today's single, standalone-local `memory` server (which runs `scripts/bootstrap.mjs` against the in-repo `apps/memory` build). Target shape:

   ```jsonc
   // plugins/memory/.mcp.json (end state)
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "red-memory": { /* version-aware launcher: fetch dev-style bundle from the red-memory release */ },
       "red-ui":     { /* version-aware launcher: fetch @reddb-io/ui-mcp bundle from the red-ui release */ }
     }
   }
   ```

   Both resolve their bundle by **version** (the same version-keyed launcher pattern as `dev`/`code-nav`, ADR 0038), so the fetch coordinates on one version id (see ADR 0040). The `dev` plugin keeps only `code-nav`.

4. **Prerequisites in the owning repos:**
   - `red-memory` receives the migrated implementation and publishes a self-contained bundle as a GitHub release asset.
   - `red-ui` bundles `ui-mcp` self-contained and attaches it to its release (today it only npm-publishes `@reddb-io/ui-mcp` + attaches desktop/embed assets).

## Consequences

- red-skills shrinks to the `dev` plugin (code-nav, AFK, skills) plus thin consumption of `red-memory` / `red-ui`. The ~55k-line memory app, its tests, hooks, and memory skills leave for `red-memory`.
- Per-repo ownership mirrors the product split (reddb / red-memory / red-ui); the visualizer is never duplicated here.
- `memory` → `red-memory` is a **client-contract rename**: any agent config or doc referencing the `memory` MCP server must update; the routing-guide is fixed to emit the real runnable command.
- **Large multi-repo migration** — sequenced, not atomic: stand up `red-memory` from the migrated code, bundle + release it, bundle `red-ui`'s `ui-mcp`, then rewire red-skills' `.mcp.json` to fetch both, then retire `apps/memory`. Open red-skills issues (#370–#374 and others) that target `apps/memory` move with it.
- **Partially reverses ADR 0034** (which placed memory under `apps/memory`) — for memory only; `dev` stays in red-skills.

## Status

**Reversed by Amendment 1 (2026-06-20).** The original direction (migrate memory
to a separate `red-memory` repo, consume via release fetch, retire `apps/memory`)
is cancelled. Memory stays in red-skills as the local `red-memory` MCP; the only
surviving change is the `memory` → `red-memory` server rename, already applied.

## Amendment 1 (2026-06-20) — REVERSED: memory stays in red-skills

The core decision of this ADR — migrate `apps/memory` out to a dedicated
`red-memory` repo and have red-skills consume it as a fetched release bundle — is
**reversed**. It was scaffolded (`reddb-io/red-memory` was created 2026-06-08) but
never delivered: that repo is an empty skeleton with **zero releases** and no
activity since creation, so the "consume a fetched `red-memory` bundle / retire
`apps/memory`" path has been blocking #378 indefinitely on a prerequisite that is
not coming. Memory has run from the in-repo build the entire time and is fully
functional, so there is no operational reason to keep waiting on the split.

**New decision:**

- **Memory stays in red-skills.** `apps/memory` (`@reddb-io/memory`) remains the
  live, in-repo source of the memory plugin and is **not** retired; red-skills
  keeps building it.
- **`red-memory` is a local MCP, not a repo.** The memory MCP is the `red-memory`
  server already wired in `plugins/memory/.mcp.json`, which execs the in-repo
  `scripts/bootstrap.mjs mcp` (built from `apps/memory`). It is RedDB-backed
  (`@reddb-io/sdk`) and exposes the `memory_*` tool surface locally. There is no
  fetch-from-release for memory.
- **No `red-memory` GitHub repo dependency.** The `reddb-io/red-memory` scaffold
  is abandoned and should be archived (or left dormant). No red-skills surface
  fetches from it.

**What survives from the original decision:**

- The **server rename `memory` → `red-memory`** in `plugins/memory/.mcp.json`
  (decision item 2) — already applied and kept; a good name independent of where
  the code lives.
- **`red-ui` as a consumed visualizer MCP** — kept (today wired via
  `npx @reddb-io/ui@latest`).
- **`code-nav` stays in the `dev` plugin** — unchanged.

**What is cancelled:**

- Decision item 1 (migrate `apps/memory` → `red-memory` repo; retire it here).
- Decision item 3's "fetch the `red-memory` bundle from its repo's release" —
  memory runs from the local build; only `red-ui` remains a fetched/external
  consumer.
- Decision item 4's `red-memory` release prerequisite.

**Consequences of the reversal:**

- **#378** (the tracking issue for this migration) is **moot** and is closed as
  not-planned — the migration it tracked is cancelled.
- The partial reversal of ADR 0034 no longer applies to memory: `apps/memory`
  stays under the root `apps/` layout (ADR 0060).
- INDEX.md cross-references that read "post-0041, the memory runtime is fetched
  from `red-memory`" / "no longer built in red-skills" are corrected in this
  change.
- `/dev:doctor` check 6 (which flags the standalone-local `memory`/`red-memory`
  server as drift from the consumer shape) must be updated so the **local** shape
  is the intended one, not drift. Tracked as a follow-up.

## Related

- ADR 0029 — runtime ships as a release-asset bundle fetched by a bootstrap (the fetch model the original decision reused; no longer applied to memory).
- ADR 0034 — monorepo `apps` domains (memory stays under `apps/`, per this reversal + ADR 0060).
- ADR 0060 — root `apps/` + `packages/` layout that `apps/memory` keeps.
- `../red-ui` — the owning repo for the visualizer MCP (still external). `reddb-io/red-memory` is an abandoned scaffold, not a dependency.
