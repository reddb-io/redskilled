# 0053 — Provider tidy is report-only governance until an explicit soft-merge approval

## Status

accepted. Report-only governance: provider tidy never mutates governed recall on
its own — a recommendation takes effect only behind an explicit, approval-gated
`SAME_AS`/`MERGED_INTO` Soft-merge edge. Part of the Odysseus-inspired Memory
governance line (PRD #484).

## Context

Provider-backed tidy may help Memory find duplicate or near-duplicate evidence, but its output is not canonical graph evidence. Memory persists tidy results as non-canonical provider review artifacts keyed by a fingerprint over the relevant nodes/edges plus operation and review-policy version; `memory governance` reports those recommendations read-only and degrades to deterministic output when provider tidy is unavailable. A recommendation affects governed recall only after an explicit mutating workflow accepts it and creates an approval-gated `SAME_AS`/`MERGED_INTO` Soft-merge edge.

This keeps Odysseus-style conservative tidy useful without letting provider output silently collapse the RedDB Memory graph, bypass provenance, or turn governance into a mutating surface.
