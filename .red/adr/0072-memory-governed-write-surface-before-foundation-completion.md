# 0072 — Memory ships governed write surface before completing the moat foundation

## Status

accepted.

## Context

ADR 0023 put the Memory moat foundation ahead of surface expansion: vector/hybrid recall, VCS/time-travel memory, operational telemetry, and graph analytics were meant to become real before demos, broad MCP/API expansion, or competitive benchmarks drove the roadmap.

Headroom changed the competitive pressure. Its memory story is easier to demonstrate because agents can save and search cross-agent memory quickly, while its `learn` flow turns failures into agent instructions. RedSkills Memory still wins on governed operational evidence, provenance, validation awareness, and review gates, but that advantage is not visible enough without a write-capable cross-agent path.

## Decision

Memory amends ADR 0023 for the next delivery cycle: ship a governed write MCP surface and cross-agent smoke test before completing the full moat foundation.

The first write surface is `memory_store_evidence`, not a raw `memory_save` clone. It is exposed through MCP for cross-agent interop plus a CLI companion for deterministic tests and operator inspection; both adapters call the same shared write policy and execution function. The caller provides claim, source reference, citation excerpt, intent, and observer identity; a deterministic server-side policy returns a **Governed write result** with `stored`, `proposed`, or `rejected`. Only source-cited, low-blast-radius validation **Operational evidence** may be stored directly through **Low-risk autopromotion**, and direct `stored` writes require graph mode in the first slice. Medium- or high-blast-radius writes become **Evidence cards** or proposals.

The first smoke test is deliberately narrow: one agent stores validation evidence, another agent recalls it with provenance, and the result shows the policy decision. CI may run this as a deterministic runner-labeled test, while docs and manual validation show real cross-agent interop against the same graph store. This keeps the demo crisp without relaxing Memory's governance model.

If graph mode is unavailable, `memory_store_evidence` returns `rejected` with an infrastructure reason such as `graph_mode_required`. It does not fall back to markdown-only mode or create an Evidence card for storage unavailability.

## Consequences

The foundation from ADR 0023 remains the moat, but it no longer blocks the first user-visible write/cross-agent proof. The next PRD after the governed write surface is `memory learn`/`memory refine`, because it reuses the same artifacts and governance to answer Headroom's failure-learning story without silent instruction rewrites. Benchmarks and Workbench copy should show "mistakes avoided" and governed provenance, not only recall or token savings. Future write tools must justify any expansion against this ADR's server-owned policy and review-gated mutation boundary.
