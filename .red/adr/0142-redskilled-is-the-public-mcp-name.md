# 0142 — `redskilled` is the public MCP name; castle remains the substrate

- **Status**: accepted
- **Date**: 2026-08-11
- **Related**: ADR 0120 (complete project MCP), ADR 0123 (MCP-first clients), ADR 0130 (`redskilled` host service), ADR 0134 (one situational front door)

## Context

The dev plugin still registered its complete execution MCP as `castle`. That
name came from the `red-castle` package that originally owned most of the tool
implementations. ADR 0130 then made `redskilled` the operator-facing service for
host reach, project registration, Worker birth, limits, and placement. An agent
now had to translate between a `redskilled` service, a `/redskilled` operations
skill, and a differently named `castle` MCP before it could call the interface
that joins those capabilities.

The MCP is not a transparent daemon proxy. It also exposes project-local queue,
GitHub, gate, landing, claim, Worktree, and red-castle state operations. Naming
the public boundary after `redskilled` therefore identifies the system an
operator talks to; it does not move project semantics into the host daemon or
rename the substrate.

Codex and Claude must also reach the same published artifact. A host-specific
download path would make the server name converge while its delivery diverged.

## Decision

**The dev plugin registers the complete project MCP as `redskilled`.** Its host
tool prefix is derived from that name, its prompt namespace is `redskilled:*`,
and its subscribable lane resource uses `redskilled://`.

The shipped delivery surface follows the same name:

- launcher: `plugins/dev/hooks/redskilled-mcp.sh`;
- bundle: `redskilled-mcp.bundle.min.mjs`;
- npm bin: `red-skills-redskilled-mcp`.

Installed Codex and Claude sessions execute that bin through the same canonical
version-pinned command:

```text
npx -y -p @reddb-io/red-skills@<version> red-skills-redskilled-mcp
```

Neither host owns a binary download mechanism. The launcher may execute a local
bundle only from an identifiable source checkout, as a development fallback.

`red-castle`, `.red/state/castle/`, `red.castle.*` wire contracts, and internal
`Castle*` TypeScript names remain unchanged. They name the execution substrate,
durable project state, and existing contracts rather than the installed MCP
server. No duplicate `castle` server alias is registered: two copies of the
complete tool surface would double the resident process and make discovery
ambiguous. A plugin reload or a new session applies the rename.

Every published skill and agent-read reference calls the server `redskilled`.
A documentation ratchet scans the whole skill tree so a backward route to the
old MCP name fails CI.

## Consequences

- Host-prefixed tools change from `mcp__plugin_dev_castle__<tool>` to
  `mcp__plugin_dev_redskilled__<tool>`.
- Prompts change from `castle:<intent>` to `redskilled:<intent>`.
- ADRs 0120, 0123, and 0134 keep their capability and choreography decisions;
  this record amends their public-name examples.
- `redskilled` names both the host service and its complete project-facing MCP,
  while `red-castle` remains visible only where substrate or state ownership is
  the fact being described.

## Amendment — 2026-08-19 (ADR 0147 rule 2, issue #4023)

Superseded on the MCP name alone. The dev plugin's MCP is now `rs_dev`: one
Plugin MCP per plugin, named `rs_<plugin>`, so a host that does not namespace a
server by its plugin still shows which plugin published a tool. `redskilled`
keeps everything else this record decided — it is the daemon, the binary and the
host service; it is no longer the name of a server a session mounts.

- Host-prefixed tools are `mcp__plugin_dev_rs_dev__<tool>`.
- Prompts are `rs_dev:<intent>`.

## Amendment — 2026-08-23 (`rs_dev` starts from the installed package set)

The delivery precedence above is superseded for a workstation provisioned by
`red-dev`. The verified package set already carries
`dist/redskilled-mcp.bundle.min.mjs`, and `red-dev` moves
`~/.red/skills/current` only after the complete set verifies and expands. The
MCP launcher therefore executes that resident bundle first. It does not put an
npm registry resolution on every Codex or Claude handshake.

An identifiable source checkout remains the development fallback. The pinned
`npx -y -p @reddb-io/red-skills@<version>` command remains the final fallback
for a standalone plugin installation that has no `red-dev` package set. Hosts
still share one artifact and one launcher; the amendment changes only which
already-published copy is preferred.
