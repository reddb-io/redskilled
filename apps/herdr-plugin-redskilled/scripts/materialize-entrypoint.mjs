/**
 * materialize-entrypoint — make the installed plugin root runnable on its own.
 *
 * `herdr plugin install reddb-io/red-skills/apps/herdr-plugin-redskilled` downloads
 * THIS DIRECTORY and nothing above it. The checkout's entry imports `@reddb-io/toon`
 * and `@reddb-io/build-info`, which are workspace links resolved by a `pnpm install`
 * of the 19-package monorepo — so on a machine with no checkout the install
 * completed and every pane died on `No such file or directory` (issue #3060).
 *
 * The cure is the repo's own dist-bundle pattern: every release attaches
 * `herdr-plugin-red-skills.bundle.min.mjs`, one esbuild file with those two
 * dependencies inlined, and this build hook writes it over `bin/red-skills-herdr.mjs`.
 * The bundle IS that file, bundled — same argv surface, same `--version`, same
 * absolute path every pane, action and startup hook in `herdr-plugin.toml` already
 * names — so nothing downstream of the entry has to know which layout it is in.
 *
 * **A checkout materializes nothing.** When the workspace dependencies resolve, the
 * source entry is the better one to run: it is the file a contributor is editing,
 * and `herdr plugin link` exists precisely so that edit is what the panes show.
 *
 * Dependency-free on purpose — it runs at install time, which is exactly when the
 * dependencies are the thing that is missing.
