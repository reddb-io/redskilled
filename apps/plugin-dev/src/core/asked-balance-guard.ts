// asked-balance-guard — the ratchet that keeps the GitHub balance ASKED
// (issue #3095, ADR 0132 Amendment 2).
//
// The balance this repo runs on is the answer to `GET /rate_limit`, which reports
// the true remaining budget for the whole token across every machine and costs
// nothing. The design it replaced was a ledger the daemon **accumulates**: every
// caller reports its calls, the daemon totals them. That ledger would have been
// born blind — the daemon is host-scoped by construction while a GitHub quota is
// per token, so an operator running four machines on one token would have had
// four daemons each reporting a quarter of the truth.
//
// **A LOCAL ACCUMULATOR IS THE REGRESSION THIS EXISTS TO PREVENT**, and it will
// arrive dressed as an optimization. Asking is one request; counting is free.
// Somebody reasonable will notice that the daemon already sees every call it
// executes, subtract as it goes, and land a `remaining -= cost` that is correct
// on a single-machine host and wrong by three quarters on the operator's actual
// desk. Nothing else in the tree would fail. The measurement that produced this
// ratchet only became legible because three of four machines happened to be
// switched off mid-session and the numbers suddenly started making sense.
//
// Three rules, mirroring the other ratchets here:
//
//  1. THE SWEPT SET ONLY GROWS. A directory added here is one that has stopped
//     deriving a balance. Removing one admits the derivation back.
//  2. PROSE IS NOT AN ACCUMULATOR. Comments describing what was removed —
//     including this one — are documentation, so comments are stripped before
//     matching.
//  3. READING IS NOT DERIVING. `remaining` copied out of an answer is the whole
//     point; only ACCUMULATION fails — a compound assignment, an increment, or a
//     self-referential `x = x ± n` on a quota-named binding.
//
// The positive half matters as much as the negative one: `GithubBalance.origin`
// is the single literal `"asked"`, so a counting path cannot construct a balance
// without declaring an origin that does not exist. This guard pins that literal,
// because a union widened to `"asked" | "derived"` would reopen the door in one
// line and read as a feature.
