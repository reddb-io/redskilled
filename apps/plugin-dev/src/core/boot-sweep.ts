// boot-sweep — boot-time decision logic for two /afk startup phases:
// the Unblock Sweep and the Straggler Check (afk.sh sweep_unblocked /
// straggler_check; SKILL.md "Unblock Sweep" / "Straggler Check").
//
// UNBLOCK SWEEP: for every open issue labelled `blocked:dependency`, resolve
// its `req:*` dependency edges and promote it to `ready-for-agent` ONLY when
// every referenced blocker is CLOSED. For pre-`req:*` dependency issues, the
// sweep can fall back to refs under a literal `## Blocked by` heading, but only
// while the issue is still explicitly marked `blocked:dependency`. Plain
// `ready-for-human` issues are HITL/spec gates and must never be reanimated just
// because an informational blocker issue closed.
//
// STRAGGLER CHECK: count open issues in states /afk cannot consume (unlabeled,
// needs-triage, needs-info); warn (and on a TTY prompt) when any is non-zero.
//
// All decision logic is PURE: every gh lookup is injected so the deciders
// perform no gh/git/network I/O. Mirrors the bash extraction and promote rule
// exactly:
//
//   refs="$(awk '/^## Blocked by[[:space:]]*$/{flag=1; next} /^## /{flag=0} flag' \
//            | { grep -oE '#[0-9]+' || true; } | sort -u)"
//
// i.e. take every line strictly after the literal `## Blocked by` heading up to
// (but not including) the next `## ` heading, scrape every `#<digits>` token off
// those lines, then sort -u (lexical, deduplicated).
