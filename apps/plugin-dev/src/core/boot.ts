// boot — the AFK boot-time sequence, ported from afk.sh's top-level startup
// (lines ~3344-3395: precheck → bootstrap → prune_orphans → cap_issue_attempts
// → prune_completed_remote_live_branches → prune_completed_local_branches →
// sweep_unblocked → straggler_check), plus the
// SKILL.md "Bootstrap / Hard Preconditions / Orphan Cleanup / Attempt Cap /
// Branch Cleanup / Unblock Sweep / Straggler Check" sections.
//
// This module is PURE SEQUENCING. It owns only the ORDER of the boot steps and
// the compose-decider-then-apply pattern: every step composes one of the already
// ported pure deciders (reclaim.ts / branch-cleanup.ts / boot-sweep.ts) and then
// applies the plan's side effects through injected gh/fs/git IO. No real gh, git,
// or fs call lives here — the deciders perform no IO, and `runBoot` performs IO
// only through the injected `deps`.

 *   1. precheck             — hard preconditions; a failure aborts the run.
 *   2. bootstrap + trim     — ensure dirs/worker pid; full boots cap castle history.
 *   3. orphan cleanup       — decideOrphanFate per dead-worker attempt dir, then
 *                             apply remove / restore-and-remove / keep (gh + fs).
 *   4. attempt cap          — planAttemptCap per issue, remove the reclaimed dirs.
 *   5. branch cleanup       — planLiveBranchCleanup, planLocalBranchCleanup;
 *                             delete reaped refs (git).
 *   5a. tmp janitor         — reclaim expired ADR 0098 lanes, dead closed-issue
 *                             worker dirs, and audited unknown tmp-root entries.
 *   6. docs sweep           — planDocsSweep; land stranded .red docs or halt.
 *   7. unblock sweep        — planUnblockSweep; edit labels + audit comment (gh).
 *   7a. mixed-blocked normalizer — shed stale blocked:* from queued/active issues.
 *   7b. Spec sub-issue reconcile — attach missing native sub-issue edges and
 *                                  strip stale needs-slicing on sliced Specs.
 *   7b'. death sweep        — planDeathSweep; join each classified Worker death to
 *                             the claim it left behind, release it eagerly and
 *                             requeue or park under the existing caps (ADR 0155).

 *   7c. stale-claim sweep   — planStaleClaimSweep; release each issue held only by
 *                             a cross-host claim that stopped refreshing (#627).

 * abort. The TTY "proceed anyway?" prompt is the caller's: this returns the
 * straggler warn flag, it does not block.
 *
 * When `options.skipSweeps` is set (#623, a supervised worker carrying the
