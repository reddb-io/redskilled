/**
 * config.ts — TypeScript port of scripts/config.sh.
 * Loads the dev config from `.red/config.yaml`. Per ADR 0042 the canonical
 * location is the namespaced `plugins.dev.afk.*` block; the legacy top-level
 * `afk.*` block is still read as a back-compat fallback. `loadConfig` folds the
 * namespaced keys down to the bare `afk.*` accessor keys (the namespaced
 * location wins when both are present), so every `getConfig(cfg, "afk.…")`
 * caller is unchanged. Mirrors the shell loader's semantics exactly:
 *   - documented v1 defaults seed the map;
 *   - a missing file leaves all defaults;
 *   - malformed YAML emits one warning and falls back to all defaults;
 *   - unknown keys parse fine (forward compatibility) but are never read by
 *     any documented accessor.
 *
 * Two rules the loader owns on top of that, both harvested from the castle twin
 * (issue #2245):
 *   - FAIL-CLOSED IN-PROCESS (ADR 0116). A directory that has not opted into the
 *     dev plugin (`plugins.dev.enabled: true`, ADR 0067) yields the defaults and
 *     nothing else, decided HERE rather than only at process entry, so an
 *     in-process caller that bypassed the entrypoint cannot read a disabled
 *     directory's settings.
 *   - RETIRED KEYS ARE TOMBSTONED (ADR 0117). {@link DELETED_CONFIG_KEYS} names
 *     every key that USED to mean something, so a retired key is distinguishable
 *     from an unknown forward-compat one and warns instead of silently reading
 *     as inert.
 *
 * The parser is the same constrained subset the shell uses (nested mappings
 * keyed by `[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_-]*` with 2-space indentation, scalar leaves
 * only). No yaml dependency. All values round-trip as raw strings, matching
 * `config_get` in the shell — callers compare against literals like "false".
