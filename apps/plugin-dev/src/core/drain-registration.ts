// drain-registration — what `drain` hands the daemon so a drain drains (#4101).
//
// **The MCP authors the semantics; the daemon carries them.** ADR 0130
// Amendment 4 splits the lane there, and the thin MCP (ADR 0147 §2) is exactly
// the surface that understands what an Issue, a label and a ready lane are.
// The daemon receives a query string, a typed poll plan, an argv and a prompt,
// stores them and hands them back — it never learns what any of them say.
//
// This is the piece nobody reconnected after the dev CLI was deleted: the
// registration used to be authored by the engine that #4031 removed, so every
// drain since recorded an intention the demand loop had nothing to poll for.
//
// PURE — strings in, one record out, no daemon, no filesystem, no process.
