// engine-floor — dispatch refuses (or loudly warns about) a superseded engine.
//
// **A merged fix that never runs is not a merged fix.** All three forensic
// recoveries on 2026-08-01 were the same shape: the repair landed, main was
// green, and every dispatched Worker went on running the engine from before the
// repair — because nothing at dispatch time ever compared the engine it was
// about to run against the version the registry had published. The skew was
// measurable the whole time (`published-version.ts` has owned that answer since
// #2809); nobody asked it at the one moment it decides what runs.
//
// So the dispatch asks. The resolved engine's build-info is compared to the
// published dist-tag, and a superseded engine either REFUSES or warns loudly,
// per the declared policy — naming both versions and the span of fixes the
// dispatch would forfeit. The class stops being silent either way.
//
// Two things it deliberately never does:
//
//  1. **Kill an offline dispatch.** A registry it cannot reach is a fact about
//     the network, not about the engine. Unreachable degrades to a warning and
//     proceeds; a floor that grounds a fleet whenever npm hiccups would be a
//     worse outage than the one it prevents.
//  2. **Refuse on hearsay.** Only a FRESH published answer can trigger a hard
//     refusal. A replayed record, an installed plugin or a cached bundle is
//     evidence enough to warn and never enough to stop the work, because the
//     newest thing this host happens to know about is not the same claim as
//     "the registry says you are behind".
//
// Pure. Every input is passed in, so the verdict a test poses and the verdict a
// dispatch acts on are produced by the same function.
