 *   default with a warn rather than cast through to a runtime rejection. It is
 *   passed as the provider's numeric `effort` option.
 * - **opencode** (ADR 0059, amended): the model is `<provider>/<model>` where
 *   the leading segment tells OpenCode which endpoint to dispatch to
 *   (`openrouter/...`, `openai/...`, `minimax/...`, …). AFK's effort maps to
 *   OpenCode's `variant` (its own reasoning knob — a free-form string,
 *   distinct from the numeric effort the other two take), so no gating
 *   applies. The auth key — whichever precedence entry is set, see
 *   `opencode-env.ts` — is delivered through `OpenCodeOptions.env` (the auth
 *   seam). When NO auth env-var is set, no `env` option is added; OpenCode
 *   falls back to its own default lookup and surfaces its own auth error if no
