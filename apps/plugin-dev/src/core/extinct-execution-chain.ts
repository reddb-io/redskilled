// extinct-execution-chain — the second crossing on the extinction ratchet: the
// surfaces ADRs 0147, 0148 and 0149 retire (Spec #4007, issue #4009).
//
// The first crossing (ADR 0130) ran to zero, which is why
// `EXTINCT_SOURCE_BASELINE` stood empty. This one started at TODAY'S COUNT and
// is being paid down slice by slice. Two lines have cleared:
//
//   - the `red-castle` package specifier — issue #4013 moved
//     `packages/red-castle` to `packages/worker` as `@reddb-io/worker`, so the 78
//     importer rename sites are gone and what remains under that entry is the
//     vendored source's own on-disk `.red-castle` config directory and cache-key
//     vocabulary, which are behaviour rather than naming;
//   - the DEV CLI AND ITS WORKER BODY — issue #4031 deleted the 36-command
//     router, every command it reached, the `run` body, the supervisor state
//     machine and the project-side launch template, so `dev-cli-router`,
//     `dev-worker-run-command`, `dev-bundle-supervisor` and
//     `project-launch-template` all stand at zero. `dev-cli-binary` keeps two
//     references and neither is a reader: one is the ratchet that REFUSES the
//     name in a doc, and one is the container lane whose Worker body moves in
//     its own slice.
//
// What is still owed is the janitor, the client-checkout reclaim it planned
// with, and the vendored `red-castle` vocabulary.
//
// Declaring the inventory BEFORE the deletion is what makes the deletion a
// ratchet rather than a hope — a slice may lower a count, and a slice that
// raises one is reintroducing the surface the ADR retired.
//
// **A COUNT IS A DEBT WITH A NUMBER ON IT.** Each entry pairs the noun with what
// it owned and names the route that replaced it — `rs_dev` and the other Plugin
// MCPs for workflow verbs, `redskilled` for process lifecycle, `@reddb-io/worker`
// for the Worker body, and the daemon's own workspace and evidence lanes for
// everything the janitor used to fear.
//
// The three surviving surfaces are deliberately NOT reddened, because a ratchet
// that reds the replacement teaches the next slice to rename the wrong thing:
// the `redskilled` binary and its own `cli.ts`, the daemon's `launch-template.ts`
// and its `reclaim.ts`, and rsp's resident vocabulary (`resident-core`,
// `resident-client`, `resident-server`) whose code ADR 0147 keeps for the
// fold-in.
