// extinct-source-guard — the ratchet that keeps the Fleet, the Attempt and the
// per-project supervisor extinct (issue #2795, Spec #2772, ADR 0130).
//
// ADR 0130 extinguished three nouns. The Fleet lost its reason to exist once the
// budget went host-wide and each project got exactly one demand producer; the
// Attempt was already a synonym of the Worker, so its lane, contract and
// retention rule recorded no additional fact; and Amendment 4 removed the
// per-project PROCESS by DELETION rather than rename (#2909), because
// `project_start` called it a demand producer, `project_status` answered with the
// key `supervisor:` and its command line was `__supervise` — three names for one
// process is the shape saying it has no place in the model that replaced it, and
// a fourth word would preserve the confusion. Deleting the code is the crossing.
// Keeping it deleted is a different job: nothing in the tree fails when a later
// slice reads a fleet profile again "just to attribute a worker", and the noun
// comes back one convenience at a time.
//
// **A READER OF AN EXTINCT SOURCE IS A REGRESSION, NOT A STYLE PREFERENCE.**
// Every entry in `EXTINCT_SOURCES` names an artifact ADR 0130 removed, what it
// used to answer, and where a reader goes instead — so the failure teaches the
// route rather than only refusing the reference.
//
// This is the crossing-ratchet pattern of ADR 0125, one step further along:
//
//  1. FINDINGS ONLY DECREASE. `EXTINCT_SOURCE_BASELINE` declares the locations a
//     crossing has not cleared yet, with a count. A slice may clear a location;
//     a slice that adds a reference beyond the declared count fails, so the
//     inventory can never be rewritten to hide a reintroduction.
//  2. THE RATCHET RUNS EVERY GATE, MID-CROSSING OR NOT. The ADR 0130 crossing
//     ran to zero, which promoted this invariant into `REPO_INVARIANT_SUITES`:
//     it runs in EVERY gate run, including a cone-scoped one that touched a
//     single unrelated package. A SECOND crossing now runs on the same ratchet
//     — ADRs 0147/0148/0149, declared in `./extinct-execution-chain.ts` — and it
//     starts at today's counts rather than at zero, because its surfaces are
//     still standing. The promotion is not undone by that: a baseline entry
//     tolerates exactly its declared count, so the check is green today and
//     reds the moment a reference is added.
//  3. PROSE IS NOT A READER. Comments explaining what was removed — including
//     this one — are the migration's own documentation, so comments are stripped
//     before matching. A reference in code or in a path/tool-name literal counts.
//  4. A NAME IS A SECOND DIMENSION. `EXTINCT_SOURCES` catches a reader reaching
//     for something removed; `EXTINCT_NAMES` catches the concept coming back as
//     VOCABULARY — a module basename or an identifier carrying an extinct noun's
//     name — even when nothing removed is read. Issue #2850 is why: the
//     supervisor's `attempt-accounting.ts` imported nothing extinct, so the
//     source dimension saw a clean file while a live module still keyed resource
//     accounting to a unit of work that no longer exists. Both dimensions fail
//     the same way, through the same baseline and the same message.
