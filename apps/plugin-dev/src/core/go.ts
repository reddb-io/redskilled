// go — the `/go` dispatch planner (ADR 0081, PRD #928 / issue #938 / S4).
//
// `/go` is the semi-structured front door between `/goal` and `/afk`. It mints a
// DISPOSABLE tracking issue in an ISOLATED LANE (`lane:go`, out of
// `ready-for-agent` so the running fleet can never claim it), spins a DEDICATED
// castle worker of kind `go`, and reuses the ENTIRE AFK engine end-to-end with
// `origin=go`, `--kind go`, and the INTERACTIVE
// (pause/ask) gate sink. The disposable issue auto-closes on merge because the
// engine's PR body already carries `Closes #N` (core/merge.ts).
//
// IO-free: every effect (label, issue create, engine run) is injected, so the
// dispatch DECISIONS — lane label, disposable body, namespaced root, engine
// argv, gate context — are pure and unit-testable with zero gh or subprocess.

// the tree clean". The INTENT is right and worth keeping — a mirror that only
// exists in the generator's head is exactly the drift that reddens the next
// branch to touch it. The TAIL, however, is half-blind: `git diff` reads tracked
// files only, so a generator that writes a NEW mirror file leaves an untracked
// path the check never sees, and the dispatch goes green over uncommitted
// generated output.
//
// So the tail is REPLACED rather than merely justified: staging intents first
// (`git add -A --intent-to-add .`) makes untracked paths visible to `git diff`
// without staging any content, and the `--exit-code` verdict is unchanged. A
// generator that legitimately produces output the run has not committed still
// FAILS — that is the point, and a test pins it — but now it fails for new files
// too, instead of passing for them.
