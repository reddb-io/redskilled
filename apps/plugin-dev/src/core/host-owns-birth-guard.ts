// host-owns-birth-guard — the ratchet that keeps the daemon the only launcher
// (issue #2851, Spec #2772, ADR 0130 rules 2 and 6).
//
// The cutover moved Worker birth out of the per-project runtime and behind the
// `redskilled` socket. Deleting the local spawn is the crossing; keeping it
// deleted is a different job, and a harder one, because **the local spawn is
// always the convenient answer**. A slice that needs one more Worker — a
// reconcile dispatch, a probe, a retry — reaches for `child_process` and nothing
// in the tree fails. The result is not a visible regression: it is a Worker no
// host admission verdict ever judged, running outside the budget, invisible to
// the host event lane, and reported by no surface. Ticket #2784 is the warning:
// it claimed exactly this criterion and left every spawn path standing, because
// the criterion was checked by inspection.
//
// **A PER-PROJECT MODULE THAT CAN CREATE A PROCESS IS A REGRESSION.** The list
// below names the modules the cutover emptied and what each one asks instead, so
// a failure teaches the route rather than only refusing the reference.
//
// Three rules, mirroring the extinction ratchet of ADR 0125:
//
//  1. THE LIST ONLY GROWS. A module added here is a module that has stopped
//     birthing Workers. Removing one is admitting a birth path back.
//  2. PROSE IS NOT A SPAWN. Comments explaining what was removed — including
//     this one — are documentation, so comments are stripped before matching.
//  3. DELETION IS THE STRONGEST FORM, NOT A GAP. A declared site whose module is
//     GONE satisfies the invariant more completely than an emptied one — there
//     is no file left to reach from. It is declared `removed: true` so the
//     absence is a stated fact rather than a silent pass, and a site that is
//     merely missing without that declaration still fails: a module renamed out
//     from under this list would empty the ratchet with nothing failing, which is
//     the same invisibility the ratchet exists to close.
