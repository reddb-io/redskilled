/**
 * land-entry-points — every way a change reaches the trunk, written down (#4138).
 *
 * Spec #4129 states the risk in one sentence: **enumerate all land entry points
 * rather than discovering them.** A land precondition applied to the paths
 * somebody remembered is not a precondition — it is a suggestion with four
 * exceptions, and the exceptions are exactly where an unjudged change gets in.
 * The naive alternative is just as bad in the other direction: a blanket "no
 * Countersign, no land" bricks the legitimate no-agent paths, so the
 * enumeration has to say what each entry point's Countersign SOURCE is, not just that it has
 * one.
 *
 * So the deliverable is this table, and the ratchet beside it
 * (`tests/land-entry-points-guard.test.ts`) pins it in BOTH directions:
 *
 *   - **Nothing declared is fiction.** A declared module must exist, must
 *     export the entry it names, and — where it enforces — must actually
 *     reference the symbol that enforces. A table nobody consults is green by
 *     accident.
 *   - **Nothing undeclared merges.** Every file under the swept roots that
 *     reaches a land primitive is either declared here or exempt with a stated
 *     reason, so a NEW entry point inherits the obligation the moment its first
 *     `landPr` or `handoffMergeCustody` lands, rather than the next time
 *     somebody remembers to look.
 *
 * ## Why an entry point may enforce differently
 *
 * The five paths sit in four layers, and only the runtime layer can read a
 * project's Countersign lane. That is not an oversight to route around: a daemon
 * that read per-project Countersigns would hold the per-issue policy ADR 0144 keeps
 * out of it, and an engine that did would be a Worker body that knows what a
 * `.red/` is. {@link LandEntryPointEnforcement} names the three honest answers,
 * and each entry says which one it is and what pays for it.
