/**
 * land-precondition — the ledger side of ADR 0154's land rule (#4138).
 *
 * `@reddb-io/shared/land-countersign.js` owns the QUESTION every land entry point
 * asks; this module owns the ANSWER, because answering means reading the
 * Countersign lane and the lane is runtime state. The split is what lets the
 * engine's merge driver and the Worker's land request hold the same gate
 * without either of them learning where a project keeps its `.red/`.
 *
 * ## What "fresh" means, exactly
 *
 * A row authorizes a merge when it is the STANDING row for the head being
 * merged and its class is a passing one. Three things follow, and each is a
 * refusal somebody would otherwise have argued their way past:
 *
 *   - **A voided row authorizes nothing.** Supersession is an appended `voided`
 *     row (#4131), so a key whose last word was a void has no standing
 *     Countersign at all — not a weaker one.
 *   - **A judgement at another head is not a judgement at this head.** That is
 *     the entire gap ADR 0154 closes: the branch moved between gate-green and
 *     merge. The single forgiven divergence is a clean rebase, which the stable
 *     patch id proves, exactly as {@link staleHeadVerdict} forgives it.
 *   - **A stale row is VOIDED on the way to the refusal.** A ledger that keeps
 *     quietly offering a superseded authorization is one the next pass lands
 *     on; appending the void is what routes the branch to re-review instead.
 *
 * `verifier-failed` and `verifier-blocked` refuse under their own names rather
 * than collapsing into "no Countersign", because a reviewer that RAN and refused is
 * work for the implementer while a reviewer that could not run is a runner to
 * repair — and #4137 writes both.
