// landing — the flag-toggled landing of a completed Attempt's worker branch
// into its base (ADR 0030 amended by #842 / 0031). Carved out of process-issue
// so the push → pre_merge → land → (direct-merge conflict self-resolve) →
// post_merge sequence has one owner and a direct test surface.
//
// PURE SEQUENCING over injected ports. The push, the merge-stage executor, the
// conflict resolver, the merge hooks, and the landing-worktree provisioner are
// all injected; no real git/gh runs here.
//
// LANDING MODE IS DECOUPLED FROM THE LOCK (#842). The branch-lock (ADR 0031)
// only resolves the target `base` (lock > pin > main); the `openPr` flag —
// `afk.worktree_launches_pull_request`, default true — independently chooses the
// landing MODE. Neither mode touches the primary checkout (issue #572):
//   - openPr=false (DIRECT) → merge --no-ff + push + conflict self-resolution
//                run inside an isolated detached worktree at <base>.
//   - openPr=true  (PR)     → `landPr` (admin-merged PR into <base> carrying the
//                attempt history). The merge is remote, so no pre-merge local
//                integrate runs — that step used to fail the whole landing on a
//                diverged primary.
//
// The caller maps a non-ok result to its merge-conflict terminal-failure path.
// On success it closes; for the direct path the merge sha is carried back on the
// result (`mergeSha`) since the primary HEAD no longer advances.
