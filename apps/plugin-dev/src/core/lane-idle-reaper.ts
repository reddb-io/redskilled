// lane-idle-reaper — the solo `run` worker's lane-idle stall reaper (issue #363).
//
// Fleet Mode (the supervisor) has had a passive stall detector + hard stall
// reaper for a while; a SOLO `/afk run` worker had no equivalent. The fatal
// "hang forever" case is already removed by the in-process attempt PROGRESS
// guard (#400, commit-anchored — aborts at the attempt-timeout cap, solo and
// fleet). This module is the COMPLEMENTARY faster layer: cut an idle hang at the
// stall threshold (minutes) rather than only at the progress cap, with the same
// busy-predicate so a mid-build/test worker is never killed.
//
// It is NOT a second mechanism. It REUSES the fleet machinery:
//   - the fleet stall DETECTOR  — the red-castle `evaluateLiveness` evaluator
//     (ADR 0083 §3): lane silent ≥ soft threshold AND (if armed) no live
//     descendants → stalled. The verdict is injected via `livenessVerdict` so
//     the reaper is fully testable without a real process tree or lane file.
//   - the reaper-signal PREDICATE — `deriveSnapshot` + `decideReaperSignal`
//     (reaper-signal.ts): the irreversible kill is gated on no active build/test
//     descendant AND flat cpu.
// This is exactly the composition `pollStallDetector` performs for the fleet,
// re-shaped as a continuous side-channel poller for the solo path. It does NOT
// duplicate or re-implement the #400 progress guard — that watches commits; this
// watches the agent lane.
//
// SIGNAL HYGIENE (#243 / #1022): the liveness signal is the red-castle
// `evaluateLiveness` evaluator over the attempt's `liveness.lane.jsonl` —
// never `afk.log` or the firehose `agent.log.toonl`, which the per-minute
// heartbeat keeps fresh and would mask a real stall. The caller wires
// `livenessVerdict` to a sync probe that reads the liveness lane and calls
// the evaluator (runtime/wire.ts `agentLivenessVerdictSync`).
//
// The reaper runs in a SIDE-CHANNEL (an injected periodic scheduler) independent
// of the inner-agent stream, so a fully-hung runner is still observed and reaped.
// On a kill verdict it calls `abort` once — wired by the caller to the sandcastle
// run's AbortSignal, which SIGTERMs the inner pipeline tree then SIGKILLs after
// the grace, the same tree-wide teardown the fleet reaper performs. The aborted
// run then flows through the existing no-sentinel terminal policy (envelope +
// label rotation + worktree teardown).
