// lane-retention-guard — retention is a WRITER-enforced contract, and the
// registry is the one place it is declared (issue #3645).
//
// Two drifts made a declared ceiling meaningless in practice. `castle-history`
// carried `maxLines: 10_000` that only BOOT applied, so a long-lived generation
// grew the ledger without bound between restarts — registered, unenforced. The
// daemon's own event lane ran the opposite way: its writer trimmed correctly
// off a private `DEFAULT_REDSKILLED_EVENT_LANE_MAX_BYTES`, which meant the
// number lived where no census could audit it — enforced, unregistered.
//
// Neither shape is visible to a type checker: one is a policy nobody reads, the
// other a constant nobody registers. So the mapping is DECLARED here — lane →
// the writer modules that consume its policy — and the guard pins that
// declaration against the live registry, the live census, and the live tree in
// both directions.
