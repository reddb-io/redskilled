// core/manager/effort-lease.ts — per-effort writer lease (Spec #2290, slice #2292).
//
// One lease, one file: `<manager root>/.red/manager/leases/<effort-id>.toonl`.
// The lease records which host+session currently holds the write cursor for an
// effort. Acquire on manage (start or resume), release on end. No daemon — the
// only crash recovery is TTL expiry: a stale lease is reclaimed by the next
// session with a generation bump, so a resurrected old writer fails closed on
// its next saveEffort call (its generation no longer matches the stored one).
//
// Generation semantics:
//   The lease records the effort's generation at acquisition time. On a stale
//   reclaim the reclaimer saves the effort first (bumping generation N → N+1),
//   then writes the lease at N+1. The old writer still holds generation N and
//   receives ManagerGenerationError on its next saveEffort — this is the
//   "fails closed" guarantee.
//
// Lifecycle transitions:
//   manageEffort — inbox | paused → active (+ acquire/reclaim lease)
//   endEffort    — active → completed (+ release lease)
