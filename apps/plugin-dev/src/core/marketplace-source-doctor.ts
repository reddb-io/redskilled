/**
 * marketplace-source-doctor.ts — who owns this machine's RedSkills marketplace?
 *
 * red-dev acquires RedSkills and wires the host CLIs, and what it registers is a
 * **directory** source pointing at the tree it manages. That is the healthy
 * shape, so this audit never touches one: repointing a directory registration
 * at the GitHub repository — which is what this doctor used to offer, and what
 * `scripts/install.sh` used to do on every re-run — tears out red-dev's wiring
 * and installs a second owner of the same machine (#3978).
 *
 * A `github` or `git` registration is the retired standalone installer's own
 * leftover. It still resolves, so it is reported rather than reded, and its
 * cure is the bootstrap, not another registration this doctor writes.
 *
 * Pure and IO-free like the other `core/` doctors: the host CLI transcript is
 * injected, so the audit reads facts and never asks a machine.
