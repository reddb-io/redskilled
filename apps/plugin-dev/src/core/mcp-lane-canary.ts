// mcp-lane-canary — the MCP lane's own liveness proof (ADR 0128 §7).
//
// `project_start` once spawned every slot against a bundle that cannot route
// `run`; each slot died before writing a worker directory, so workers created
// through the CANONICAL interface drained zero issues while the CLI lane kept
// working and no surface reported the difference (#2677). A merged fix proves
// nothing there: the defect only exists in the shipped bundle, exercised
// through the real MCP transport.
//
// This module is the step machine, kept IO-free so both the real transport
// (runtime/mcp-lane-canary-io.ts) and the regression tests drive the same
// ordered contract. Every step names itself on failure, so a red canary reports
// WHICH step went inert instead of "the lane did nothing".
//
// **What the lane is changed under ADR 0130 Amendment 3 (#2902): the MCP
// registers, the daemon drives.** Starting work no longer launches a process of
// the project's own — it hands the host a repository identity, an opaque
// selector, an opaque argv and a target, and the host owns every birth from
// there. So the canary's load-bearing assertion INVERTED. It once refused to
// accept a returned supervisor pid as evidence of drainage; it now refuses to
// accept a lane that produced any process of its own at all, and reads the
// registration the daemon handed back as the lane's only proof of life.
//
// The socket is still the boundary that decides the walk — a start that cannot
// reach the daemon must REFUSE rather than fall back to spawning (ADR 0130 rule
// 6), and `project_start` going inert while naming that socket is what a dead
// host looks like from here.
//
// **The walk goes on past the registration (#2908).** A lane that registers and
// then does nothing looks identical, from the project's side, to one that drains:
// the difference lives in the daemon, so the canary asks it directly. It watches
// for the ONE aliased poll that covers this project (Amendment 3's whole claim,
// which a per-project poller would fail by request count alone) and then for the
// Worker that poll justified — read back from the host, never inferred from a
// directory, because a pid file cannot say whether a birth was ever admitted.
