// merge — integrate / land primitives for the AFK merge stage (ADR 0030/0031).
//
// Ported from scripts/lib/merge.sh + the do_merge / land_pr landing in afk.sh.
// Pure decision logic and exact git/gh argv construction over an injected
// executor: every real command goes through `Exec`, and the facts that drive a
// branch ("is local strictly behind origin", "is the session locked") are
// inputs rather than IO. That keeps the integrate decision and the lock-toggled
// landing unit-testable against fixed inputs, with no real git/gh ever run.
//
// Landing is lock-toggled (ADR 0030):
//   - LOCKED   → merge the attempt directly into the locked branch with
//                `git merge --no-ff` and push it; a rejected push rolls the
//                merge commit back to the captured pre_merge_sha.
//   - UNLOCKED → land via a PR into the pinned target (force-push the attempt
//                branch, open or reuse the PR, `gh pr merge --merge`), then
//                fast-forward local <target> to the merge commit.

// ---------- CI-aware merge (#812) ----------
//
// A PR merge (`gh pr merge --merge`) does NOT bypass required status checks.
// Merging a just-opened PR whose required checks are still pending is therefore
// rejected — and historically AFK bucketed that rejection into `merge-conflict`,
// mislabelling a perfectly MERGEABLE PR and re-running the whole inner agent.
// CI-aware merge fixes this: poll `mergeStateStatus` + `statusCheckRollup` until
// the PR settles, then merge only when it is genuinely ready, and DISTINGUISH the
// failure modes (conflict vs a failed required check vs checks merely pending).

/**
 * Normalised verdict for the CI-aware merge poll:
 *   - `merge`     — ready to merge (CLEAN, or non-required checks flaky; BLOCKED
 *                   by a required review is attempted and surfaces as `merge-failed`
 *                   rather than being bypassed).
 *   - `conflict`  — a genuine git conflict (DIRTY / `mergeable=CONFLICTING`).
 *                   Maps to the existing bounded `merge-conflict` recovery.
 *                   BEHIND is deliberately NOT here — see `classifyMergeState`.
 *   - `ci-failed` — a required check FAILED. A distinct outcome so the next
 *                   attempt fixes the red check, not a blind full re-run.
 *   - `pending`   — required checks still running / GitHub still computing. The
 *                   poll keeps waiting; on timeout the caller hands off the open PR.

 * Runs for BOTH lock states (ADR 0083 §2 amended). The §2 invariant existed to

 *   1. no-op unless the primary is actually ON `<target>` (a locked primary is
 *      pinned to main; if the human moved HEAD, leave it alone);
 *   2. no-op if the working tree is DIRTY (uncommitted WIP is sacred, #1019);
 *   3. advance a strict ancestor with `merge --ff-only`; a divergent local is
 *      eligible only when every local-only commit has a patch-equivalent
 *      remote-only commit, in which case the local commits are superseded;
 *   4. reset only the clean, fully-superseded divergence to the fetched remote
 *      tip — never merge or discard a local patch origin does not carry.
