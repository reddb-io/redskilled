// phase-durations — what each phase of the pipeline actually costs, measured (#3097).
//
// **An honest ETA needs a duration model, and the ledger held none.**
// `.red/state/castle/history.toonl` records one `duration_s` per terminal
// issue-level event, so the finest answer it can give is "issues like this one
// took ~22 min on this runner" — true, useless to a progress bar, and unable to
// say anything at all about a Worker three minutes into `validating`. This lane
// records the missing grain: one row per phase a Worker LEAVES, with the seconds
// it spent there.
//
// **A linear extrapolation from the bar is refused, and this file is the
// alternative.** `phase_index / phase_total` moves with the cursor, so an ETA
// derived from it looks precise while being systematically wrong — `coding` and
// `validating` do not cost the same, and no amount of averaging fixes an estimate
// whose only input is a position. Every function here reads measured seconds per
// PHASE NAME and nothing else; none of them takes an index or a total. That is
// structural, not a convention: the signatures cannot express the wrong estimate.
//
// **A phase nobody has measured enough of gets no estimate.** `null` is the
// answer whenever any phase between here and the end is short of samples, because
// an estimate assembled from one observation of `merging` is a number the
// dashboard would print with the same confidence as a well-founded one. Ship no
// ETA rather than that one.
//
// The lane is TOONL under the durable castle state root, beside the ledger it
// refines. Everything except the file IO is pure: the clock is a parameter.
