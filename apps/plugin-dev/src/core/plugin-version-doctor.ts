// plugin-version-doctor — is the plugin that answers actually current? (#3147)
//
// **Two update lanes exist and only one was watched.** The BUNDLE lane
// self-updates and works: `redskilled-stable.current` tracks the published version, the
// status file says `up-to-date`, and a registration's argv correctly names the
// newest cached bundle. The PLUGIN lane — the host's own install, which carries
// the MCP server and the skills — is updated by the agent host's plugin manager,
// and nothing here ever looked at its version.
//
// It sat eight releases behind while every surface read green. `red-doctor`
// reported `marketplace findings: 0`, and `mcp-load-doctor` asked only whether
// servers loaded, never which bundle answered them.
//
// **The skew is invisible from the outside, which is why it needs a probe.** The
// MCP server is what COMPOSES a project registration; an old adapter registers
// with an empty launch environment and writes the CURRENT bundle path into the
// argv. So a fresh Worker runs new code, born from a registration composed by
// old code, and every version number on screen is true about something else.
// That cost a full session of debugging a fix that had already shipped.
//
// PURE: the caller reads the filesystem and the registry; this decides.
