/**
 * project-attribution — deciding which live Workers are THIS project's (#3081).
 *
 * **The join is on one id, and the whole defect was that there were two.** The
 * daemon owns birth, so the id it minted is the Worker's identity; the project
 * adopts that string from `RED_AFK_WORKER_ID` and files its worker directory,
 * its claim comment and every project-side surface under it. When the launch
 * env never reached the process, the project minted a second id instead, and
 * this predicate compared one id space against the other — false for every
 * Worker, always. `project_status` then rendered a project whose two Workers
 * were mid-review as `live_workers: []` with `busy: 0`.
 *
 * **A predicate that matches nothing is reported, never rendered as calm.** The
 * disjoint case and the genuinely-foreign case produce the same empty list, and
 * only one of them is a working system: a host holding Workers for this project
 * while none of the live Workers matches any of them is the structural failure,
 * and it says so in the answer rather than looking like an idle repository.
 *
 * PURE: every input is passed in, the host's answer included.
