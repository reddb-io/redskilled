// The classification is PURE, mirroring branch-cleanup.ts: the orphan decider
// takes the already-resolved issue state, label, envelope flag, dir age, and a

// their mtime and liveness. No module here performs fs / gh / date I/O — the
// caller resolves those and injects them. Attempt paths are parsed with the
// shared worker-paths.ts parser so the nested layout stays single-sourced.
