// reconcile — the NO-AGENT worker mode (ADR 0055).
//
// For an issue AFK *owns* — one carrying an `afk/{id}/{N}-*` worker branch that
// was parked under a MECHANICAL failure class (`blocked:stalled` /
// `blocked:crashed`, or, inline, a just-fired attempt-progress-guard timeout) —
// reconcile validates the pushed branch and lands it WITHOUT re-running the
// agent. The agent re-run stays recovery.ts; this is the cheaper path that
// catches the common case where the agent finished the work but stalled / exited
// before a final non-committing step, so a complete-and-green branch was left
// parked.
//
// The flow mirrors the DONE path's tail, composing the SAME building blocks — no
// new merge code:
//   1. guard      — mechanical class only (never blocked:spec / a non-mechanical
//                    active `## Current blocker`).
//   2. fetch gate — branchPresent() fetches origin-only branches before the diff.
//   3. commits gate — the branch must carry work (changedFiles vs base).
//   4. runFeedback — the scoped gate is the verdict, the SAME authority the DONE
//                    path trusts.
//   4a. green     → doLanding (landing.ts) + close + drop blocked:*/ready-for-human.
//   4b. red       → ready-for-human with the REAL failing checks (blocked:validation).
//
// PURE SEQUENCING over injected IO: every git/gh/pnpm/fs touch is a port, so the
// whole decision tree is unit-testable with zero subprocesses. Since #2665 the
// EFFECTFUL COLLABORATORS are ports too (landing, the feedback gate, the
// envelope emitter, the remote-branch pair, and the label vocabulary), so the
// module's only runtime imports are pure companions. The nested member shapes
// still mirror `ProcessIssueDeps`, and the two real construction sites
// (`commands/run/reconcile.ts`, `commands/requeue.ts`) spread ONE host wiring
// constant, `HOST_RECONCILE_PORTS` (core/reconcile-ports.ts).

// PORTIFIED IMPORTS: every EFFECTFUL collaborator below is imported `type`-only
// and injected through {@link ReconcileDeps}. The value-imports that used to sit
// here (`doLanding`, `runFeedback` + its four helpers, `emitEnvelope`,
// `pushAttempt`/`deleteRemote`, and the `LABEL_*` constants) are gone, so this
// module carries no runtime edge into the host — the precondition for crossing
// it into the castle engine. The remaining value-imports are PURE companions
// that cross WITH reconcile (`blocker-state`, `boot-sweep` planners,
// `disposition`).
