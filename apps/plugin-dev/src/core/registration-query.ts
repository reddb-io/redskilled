// registration-query — the one string a registration hands the host as its work.
//
// ADR 0130 Amendment 4 splits the lane in two: the project REGISTERS and the
// daemon POLLS. The seam between them is a single opaque string, and the daemon
// hands that string to the tracker verbatim — it "carries a selector, never
// reads one" (rule 3). Which means the string has to be a TRACKER QUERY. A
// registration that carried the project's own JSON selector shape was carrying
// something only the project can read, so the daemon dutifully asked GitHub to
// search for `{}` and got an answer about nothing (#2974).
//
// **Every facet this query can express, it expresses; the rest the Worker
// enforces.** `spec` and `issues` name graph edges and specific numbers, which
// issue search cannot filter on — so a query narrowed by the expressible facets
// counts an UPPER BOUND for those two, and the demand loop's target still caps
// how wide the project goes. The bound is stated here rather than silently
// assumed, because an over-count births a Worker that finds nothing and exits,
// while an under-count would strand real work — and only one of those is safe.
//
// PURE — string in, string out, no tracker, no filesystem, no process.
