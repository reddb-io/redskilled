// repo-invariants — repo-wide invariant suites that every gate run must include,
// no matter how narrow the cone (issue #2762).
//
// A cone-scoped gate runs the test/typecheck/lint/build of the changed packages
// and their dependents. That is correct for package-local behavior and WRONG for
// a repo-wide invariant: the TOON JSON file-I/O ratchet lives in `apps/plugin-dev` but
// constrains every file under `apps/` and `packages/`. A worker that edits only
// `apps/rsp` validates green, reports DONE, and the ratchet first fires in root
// CI — after the correction budget is spent. The invariant was enforced outside
// the only loop that could still satisfy it.
//
// The fix is a small, declared list: suites that run in EVERY gate run whose cone
// does not already cover them. Adding an invariant is a one-entry change here
// plus the package script it names.

/** One repo-wide invariant suite: a package script that constrains the whole repo. */
