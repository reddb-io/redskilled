// core/review-extract.ts — the structured-output extraction half of the advisory
// review (issue #746). Drives the vendored sandcastle review engine through
// `run()` + `Output.object`, returning the validated {@link ReviewFindings}.
//
// Structured-output retry (sandcastle 0.11.0): `Output.object({ maxRetries })`
// makes `run()` resume the failed agent session and feed back a token-efficient
// description of the extraction error so the agent re-emits a corrected `<output>`
// tag — up to `maxRetries` extra attempts — instead of aborting the attempt.
// Retries require a resumable provider (claude/codex); under OpenCode/MiniMax the
// budget resolves to 0 (a no-op) and the single-attempt advisory path must still
// work. The provider/sandbox/model wiring is injected so this module stays pure
// of the heavy `@reddb-io/worker` import in tests.
