/**
 * setup-owned-dirt.ts — working-tree dirt classification shared by red-doctor
 * and the trunk-freshness guard.
 *
 * Two individually-correct rules used to brick every fresh repository (#3106).
 * The setup contract forbids `git add` on the files setup generates, so setup
 * ends by leaving the tree dirty by design; the trunk-freshness guard refuses to
 * fast-forward a dirty primary, because pending WIP is sacred (#1019). Nothing
 * closed the loop, so the first Worker died at boot with a message about git
 * ancestry that never mentioned setup.
 *
 * The trunk guard does not use a path allowlist (#3439): every dirty path is safe
 * across a pure fast-forward when the incoming commits do not touch it. The
 * setup-owned list remains solely for red-doctor check 28, which must identify
 * uncommitted `/red-setup` output and explain how to commit or ignore it.
 *
 * A collision is classified before `merge --ff-only`: an UNTRACKED local copy
 * the incoming commits carry is moved aside, while a TRACKED local edit the
 * incoming commits also touch is real content and refuses honestly (#3155).
