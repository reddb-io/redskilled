// validation-command.ts — the gate's command-composition layer (#3041).
//
// Every `pnpm -C <dir> <script>` the post-DONE gate runs — and, more sharply,
// every one it RECORDS — is composed here. A recorded command carrying a
// RELATIVE `-C` path is unfalsifiable: it resolves against whatever the process
// cwd happened to be, so a gate that never executed a byte reads exactly like a
// branch whose typecheck failed. Worker wO0AR (#3027) recorded
// `pnpm -C afk/3027-…/apps/plugin-dev typecheck` exiting 1 after 0 ms, burned its
// re-seed budget against that phantom, and parked a branch whose own PR CI was
// fully green; the only tell was the millisecond count.
//
// Three rules, one per way that verdict lied:
//
//   1. **A checkout token resolves to an ABSOLUTE path before composition.**
//      The record then names a directory a reader can `ls`, and a token that
//      resolved nowhere is visible as such instead of reading as a package dir.
//   2. **A DECLARED checkout whose directory is missing is an infrastructure
//      error, never a red validation verdict.** An unrunnable command judged
//      nothing, so it may not consume a re-seed round or park a branch — the
//      same honesty rule the admission verdicts follow: a refusal carries what
//      it judged.
//   3. **A suite-shaped command that exits in under a second without a concrete
//      diagnostic may not have run a suite.** Turbo cache hits can return real
//      compiler, assertion, and guard failures in milliseconds, so structured
//      branch evidence always outranks duration.
//
// A branch TOKEN is left verbatim on purpose. The AFK gate is posed with the
// worker branch name (`afk/<n>-<slug>`), which the feedback-worktree executor
// materialises and rewrites onto a real checkout at exec time; absolutising it
// here would turn a branch name into a path nothing can check out. What the
// executor resolves it to comes back as `ExecResult.commandDir` and is what
// lands in the record, so the branch lane gets an absolute path too — measured
// rather than composed.
