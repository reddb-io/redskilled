 * declared all three moments reads back as having declared none. The narration
 * then reported the declaration's absence — the one thing the operator could
 * see was false, because the block was sitting right there in the file they
 * had just written.
 *
 * The two states take DIFFERENT repairs: an undeclared moment wants a block,
 * an inert directory wants `plugins.dev.enabled: true`. Telling them apart is
 * the whole job of this context.
 *
 * The field names are `ConfigLoadAudit`'s own, so an audit satisfies this
 * structurally and a caller hands over the thing it already loaded rather than
 * transcribing two fields out of it.
