// version-train-guard — one product version across every workspace, and every
// publishable surface reporting it (issue #3082).
//
// The defect this exists for is not a wrong number, it is an ABSENT LIST. The
// former changesets fixed/ignore lists left packages behind, so the herdr plugin
// drifted entirely on its own and the VS Code extension shipped every
// release stamped `0.1.0` — the field the marketplace reads. Nothing was red.
//
// So the discovery here is DERIVED, never hand-kept: the package set comes from
// the pnpm workspace globs plus the declared extra roots, which means a new app
// inherits the obligation the moment its package.json lands. A hand-kept array
// is exactly the artifact that let the herdr plugin drift.
//
// Three properties are enforced:
//
//   1. Version — every discovered manifest carries the anchor's version.
//   2. Coverage — every manifest is a confirmed Release standard Version
//      surface. Aligned-by-luck is not aligned.
//   3. Scope — every workspace is named `@reddb-io/*`, unless it carries a
//      stated exemption.
