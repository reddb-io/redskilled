// worker-display-record — the Worker's own state, said in the host's vocabulary (#3097).
//
// **The project publishes; the daemon stores; a surface prints.** Everything a
// dashboard shows about a Worker is decided HERE, in the process that owns the
// work, because that is the only process with the semantics to decide it: what a
// phase is, which of five it is, whether an origin is `afk` or `go`, and how long
// the work has left. The daemon stores the record without reading a field of it
// (ADR 0130 rule 3) and the render draws what it was handed.
//
// **The field names are the statusline's own.** `workerFields` (red-castle's
// monitor) already names every one of these signals for the line the operator
// reads locally; a second vocabulary for the same facts would mean a reader
// comparing the dashboard against the statusline beside it was translating
// instead of comparing.
//
// **Absent is `null`, never a zero** — the record's own rule, applied where this
// module can tell the difference. A Worker holding no `eta` publishes `null`; a
// runner that never reports usage publishes `null` tokens rather than `0`, which
// would read as a Worker that spent nothing. A `0` tool count, by contrast, is a
// real measurement of a Worker that has called no tool yet, and is published as
// the zero it is.
//
// PURE.
