// worker-outcome — the SINGLE OWNER of the AFK "how a worker run ended, and what
// it means" vocabulary.
//
// Historically this knowledge was smeared across three parallel enums that had
// to stay in sync by hand — `ProcessOutcome` (process-issue.ts), `BlockedReason`
// (envelope-emit.ts), and `RecoveryReason` (recovery.ts) — plus a hand-written
// bridge (`recoveryReasonOf`). Adding one terminal ending touched four files and
// any drift silently produced a wrong label or a wrong routing decision.
//
// This module collapses that into ONE owner:
//   - `WorkerOutcome`     — every terminal ending an iteration can have.
//   - `RecoveryReason`     — the recoverable subset's policy keys (recovery.ts
//                            consumes this; its cap table is keyed on it).
//   - `blockedLabelFor`    — outcome → DESCRIPTIVE `blocked:<reason>` label.
//   - `recoveryReasonFor`  — outcome → BOUNDED-recovery policy key (or null).
//   - `envelopeStatusFor`  — outcome → the terminal `data-attempt-status` facet
//                            of the emitted Envelope (envelope-emit.ts).
//
// It is PURE (no IO) — decision/mapping only. Execution (editLabels, comment, the
// cascade gh, routeRecovery) stays at the call sites. The functions are the
// canonical source for the observability label, the recovery routing key, and the
// envelope status, so the multi-enum-desync bug class becomes impossible.
