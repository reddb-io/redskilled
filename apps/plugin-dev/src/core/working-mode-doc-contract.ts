// working-mode-doc-contract — a skill that names a Plugin MCP tool is BOUND to a
// tool that exists, and the two thin entrances name no client boot phase
// (ADR 0147 rule 2, ADR 0150 §2–§3, Spec #4007, issue #4030).
//
// The Working mode says WHERE a skill's work runs; this contract says WHAT it
// calls to get there. Both had to become declared for the same reason: a skill
// text is the only thing a reader has, and until now it could name a tool that no
// longer exists, or describe a phase the client no longer runs, and every check in
// the repo stayed green — because prose compiles.
//
// Three rules the guard holds:
//
//  1. A NAMED TOOL EXISTS. Every tool a declaration binds to a skill must be
//     published on the live `rs_dev` surface, and must actually appear in that
//     skill's text. A binding to a tool nobody publishes is a promise the skill
//     cannot keep; a binding to a tool the skill stopped naming is an inventory
//     nobody pruned.
//  2. AN UNDECLARED NAMING IS A GAP. The reverse direction is discovered: any
//     published tool name a swept SKILL.md spells is compared against the
//     declaration, so a skill cannot quietly grow a dependency on a tool. Only
//     names carrying an underscore are DISCOVERED — `status`, `help`, `triage`
//     and `manager` are also ordinary English this repo writes constantly, so a
//     bare-word sweep would report the language rather than the surface. Those
//     are still bindable; they are simply never inferred.
//  3. THE ENTRANCES NAME NO CLIENT BOOT PHASE. ADR 0150 §3 makes `/afk` and `/go`
//     thin: register and arm, or dispatch once, then observe. The phases they used
//     to run first read the human's checkout — the input ADR 0144 §5 forbids — and
//     each became daemon admission or died. A skill that still names one is
//     teaching a reader an architecture nobody decided.
