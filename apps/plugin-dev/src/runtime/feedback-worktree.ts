// runtime/feedback-worktree.ts — resolve the feedback gate's worktree seam.
//
// process-issue runs the feedback gate against a checkout of the *worker
// branch* sandcastle committed on, but it only ever holds the branch NAME (it
// passes `worktree: workerBranch` into runFeedback, and runFeedback turns that
// into a `pnpm -C <worktree>/<scope>` token). The real worker branch lives only
// on origin until AFK lands it, so feedback needs a concrete checkout.
//
// This manager closes that seam: given a branch token it lazily `git worktree
// add`s a temp checkout of the branch (fetching origin first) under
// `.red/tmp/feedback/<branch-slug>`, caches it, and exposes the `pnpm` executor + `PackageLayout` probe the
// feedback gate consumes, both rebased onto the materialised checkout. Every
// worktree it created is torn down by `cleanup()` after the session.
//
// When the worktree cannot be materialised (worktreeAdd failure) or the
// declared setup (or the undeclared install fallback) fails, the gate fails
// closed: all validation calls return code 1.
// A failed setup never silently validates the primary checkout. It also NAMES
// its cause (#2964): the blocked message carries which of lock-wait timeout,
// `worktree add` failure or `pnpm install` failure fired, plus the underlying
// stderr, so the validation record it lands in is diagnosable on its own. An
// infra failure that cannot name its own cause turns every occurrence into a
// fresh investigation.
//
// AFK runner improvement — cross-session worktree cache: by default, a
// materialised worktree whose branch HEAD matches the live branch's HEAD
// is REUSED across sessions (no `worktree add` / setup command on re-claim).
// The worktree itself is the cache and is retained on a cache hit. SHA mismatch
// is the only invalidation signal; there is no mtime/TTL GC. This saves the
// install cost per re-claim (Pattern 7 of the claude-minimax spike). Opt out via
// `cacheEnabled: false` for callers that need a strict per-session manager.
//
// A worktree path is a SINGLETON across every process on the host — most
// sharply the `feedback/main` baseline every landing revalidation probes
// against. Materialising it (`worktree add` + `pnpm install`) therefore runs
// under a host-wide file lock (#2437): concurrent landings serialize instead of
// corrupting each other's setup, and the waiter re-checks the cache once it has
// the lock, so the usual outcome of losing the race is a free cache hit. When
// the wait itself times out, setup is reported as RETRYABLE. Failed setup is
// never cached: a gate round can consume several validation calls, so even a
// three-failure latch poisoned every later round after one transient fetch
// incident. The next call always gets a fresh chance to heal the environment.
