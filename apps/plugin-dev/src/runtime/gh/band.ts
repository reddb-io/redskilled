// gh/band.ts — the reserved band, applied at the boundary that spends the budget.
//
// ADR 0132 Amendment 2, issue #3095. The balance is asked by ONE poller (the
// daemon's) and interpreted here, because what a call is WORTH is castle
// semantics the daemon may not carry: `issue comment` is a finished Worker's
// closing comment on one call and an optional progress note on the next, and only
// the caller can tell them apart.
//
// **Semi-offline stops being a mode discovered through a 403.** Before this, a
// spent quota announced itself by refusing a call — which meant the first thing
// to fail was whatever happened to run first, often the claim. With an
// authoritative balance the refusal is graduated and ordered: convenience reads
// are refused once the balance enters the band, and the claim, a landing and a
// finishing Worker's closing comment keep passing until the pool has nothing left
// at all.
//
// **THE CLAIM NEVER DAMS.** Claiming is three layers — local `mkdir` lock, the
// GitHub claim marker, stale-lock boot sweep — and damming the middle one leaves
// a host-local lock: safe on one machine, and two Workers on one branch the
// moment a second host drains the same backlog. So `essential` is refused only by
// a pool with nothing left, where GitHub would refuse it anyway, and a Worker
// that cannot write its claim declines the issue rather than proceeding.
//
// **Absence of a balance opens the gate, never closes it.** No daemon, no
// credential, an endpoint that changed shape — each leaves the posture `unknown`,
// and `unknown` degrades to the reactive breaker that predates this module.
// Refusing every read on an unread balance would turn a reporting failure into an
// outage.
//
// **One daemon read per cadence, never one per call.** The gate caches the
// balance for the window the balance itself asked for, so the hot path pays at
// most one socket round trip per cadence — the same reason the balance is polled
// rather than checked before each call (ADR 0084's lesson).
