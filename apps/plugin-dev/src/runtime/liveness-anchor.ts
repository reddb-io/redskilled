// liveness-anchor.ts — THE single liveness anchor (issue #2704, Spec #2772).
//
// One anchor, one read, one verdict. `project_status`, `project_stop`, `monitor`,
// `worker_vitals` and the statusline resolve liveness through this module and
// hold NO private source of their own. Two anchors is the bug class behind #2679
// and #2698 — a writer that maintains one and a reader that trusts another
// produced `alive: false` in the same payload as a 13-second-old heartbeat and
// two busy slots.
//
// **A WORKER'S PROCESS LIVENESS RESOLVES THROUGH THE DAEMON, NEVER A PID FILE.**
// The host daemon owns birth and death, so it is the only authority that can
// answer "is this Worker still running" — a stronger one than the attempt record
// this replaced, which could only say what it had last been told. Keying that
// question on a pid file is what deleted the live lane and kept the dead ones.
//
// Three invariants make the contradictory payload unrepresentable rather than
// merely unlikely:
//
//  1. LIVENESS AND FRESHNESS COME FROM ONE RESOLUTION. The observation is
//     computed by the same function that decides the verdict, from the same read,
//     so the two can never disagree.
//  2. AN UNATTRIBUTABLE OBSERVATION IS STALE, WHATEVER ITS AGE. When no anchor
//     names a live writer, the heartbeat has nobody to vouch for it, so it is
//     `orphaned` — stale by construction. `alive: false` therefore implies
//     `stale: true` at the TYPE level for the supervisor lane.
//  3. `dead` IS ONLY REPRESENTABLE BESIDE A FRESH READ. A Worker the daemon did
//     not name is dead only when the daemon answered and its answer is current;
//     an unreachable or stale daemon answers `unknown`. So no payload can report
//     a Worker dead beside fresh evidence that it is alive.
//
// Staleness travels INSIDE the payload: every consumer receives the observation
// and renders it, so a stale read can never be presented as current and no
// consumer re-derives the verdict from an age and a threshold of its own.
