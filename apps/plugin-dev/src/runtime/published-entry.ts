/**
 * published-entry — which VERSION a Worker born right now would report.
 *
 * The answer used to be a PATH. A project's Worker inherited whatever bundle the
 * launching process happened to run, so a project stranded by a release could
 * not be repaired by restarting it: the MCP server's own plugin-cache bundle was
 * older still, the prescribed fix produced a WIDER skew, and every Worker kept
 * boot-halting (#2808, same defect class as #2736/#2677 — never infer the
 * executable from the caller's argv). This module answered by resolving the
 * published version first and then finding an entry that ran THAT version.
 *
 * **The search is gone, and the question is not.** ADR 0147 deleted the dev
 * bundle every candidate path named, and ADR 0148 makes the daemon compose its
 * own `redskilled acp-worker` launch — a client checkout is never an execution
 * input, so nothing here names an executable any more. What survives is the
 * comparison the engine floor and the fleet-truth probe both ask: WHICH VERSION
 * is on the published lane. `published-version.ts` records the same fact for the
 * reporting surfaces (#2809), and a disagreement between the two is the bug
 * class rather than a detail.
