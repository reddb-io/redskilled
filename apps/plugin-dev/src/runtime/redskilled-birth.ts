// redskilled-birth — the ONE place a project asks the host for a Worker
// (issue #2851, Spec #2772, ADR 0130).
//
// Before this module the daemon existed and nothing called it: every Worker was
// still born by the per-project runtime's own `spawn`, so the host budget, the
// per-Worker resource unit and the host event lane were code nobody reached.
// This is the crossing. **After it, a project that cannot reach the daemon
// starts nothing** — ADR 0130 rule 6, fail closed. A local fallback here would
// reinstate exactly the unbudgeted spawn the daemon exists to prevent, and would
// do it invisibly, which is the shape #2784 left behind.
//
// The module holds no work knowledge and no process mechanism. It resolves the
// project's own opaque label, hands the daemon an argv and a workspace path, and
// reports back what the host granted. Which ticket that Worker claims, which
// runner serves it and what its prompt says never enter here (rule 2), and
// neither does the spawn — the daemon owns birth, this only asks for it.
