// rsp-wait-launch — the one process the MCP surface still starts itself.

// An `rsp wait` is NOT a Worker: it claims no ticket, runs no runner, spends no
// host budget and dies when the thing it watches resolves. The daemon owns Worker
// birth (ADR 0130), and this is deliberately outside that authority.
//
// It lives in its own module because `mcp-adapter.ts` is now a declared
// `host-owns-birth` site (#2976), and that ratchet reads a MODULE rather than a
// call: a file that may not birth a Worker must hold no way to create a process
// at all, because "this particular spawn is fine" is exactly the judgement a
// ratchet exists to stop making. Keeping the wait's spawn here states the
// distinction structurally instead of asking a reader to re-litigate it.
