// standing-drain-start — the seam that makes a standing declaration REGISTER,
// without a human typing `drain` (#4293).
//
// A project's standing block is documented as the way it keeps itself registered
// across daemon restarts, plugin reloads and reboots. It only can be if something
// reads it on a surface that runs by itself, and the surface that runs by itself
// is the Plugin MCP adapter: a coder CLI mounts it at session start, so every
// session of every enabled project passes through here, and a project whose
// registration lapsed while the daemon was down is re-stated by the next one.
//
// Three properties are load-bearing and each is a refusal:
//
//  1. **STRICTLY OPT-IN.** A project that declared nothing registers nothing —
//     ADR 0067's posture. Boot-time work that starts a drain nobody asked for
//     would be worse than the defect it fixes.
//  2. **IDEMPOTENT.** The daemon's `drain` is ensure-style and its registration
//     path treats a record already held as the answer, so re-stating on every
//     session is the intended shape rather than a duplicate.
//  3. **NEVER FATAL.** A daemon that does not answer must not cost the operator
//     their tool surface. Every failure is reported and swallowed; the MCP
//     session keeps serving, and the operator's next explicit `drain` is
//     unaffected.
