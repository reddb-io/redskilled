// runtime/unblock-pass.ts — the Unblock Sweep as a STANDALONE pass (#3014).
//
// DIAGNOSIS — which clearer was expected, and why it could not fire. Three
// paths can drop a stale `blocked:dependency` label once the last `req:*`
// blocker closes:
//
//   1. the event-driven close cascade (`runCloseCascade`), reachable ONLY from a
//      worker's terminal stage or from `reconcile()` — i.e. only when the AGENT
//      is the one that closes the blocker;
//   2. the Unblock Sweep as step 7 of `runBoot`, reachable from an `/afk` boot
//      and from the redskilled MCP resident's periodic janitor;
//   3. the `unblock_sweep` MCP tool, reachable only when somebody calls it.
//
// On a repo operated through live sessions only, a HUMAN closes the blocker in
// the GitHub UI, so (1) never runs — no local code observes that tracker event
// (webhook deliveries land in the singleton lane, where only `rsp wait` reads
// them). (2) IS awake there — the resident janitor runs the boot suite every
// five minutes — but it is the SEVENTH step of a suite that routinely aborts
// before reaching it: a failing precheck returns after step 1, a red operational
// probe throws `BootHaltError` at step 1a, and step 6's docs sweep halts on any
// stranded `.red/` doc, which is the ordinary state of a repo a human edits by
// hand. So the promote path was reachable in principle and starved in practice,
// and the drift outlived every session until a human pointed at it.
//
// THE FIX starts here: the sweep expressed as a pass that needs `gh` and NOTHING
// else — no probes, no git, no worktrees, no boot suite — so the resident can
// schedule it on its own belt (`resident-unblock.ts`) where no unrelated halt
// can starve it. The IO is injected, so the promote path is provable without a
// tracker.
