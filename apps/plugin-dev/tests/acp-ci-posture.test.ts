/**
 * The CI posture issue #3878 chose, pinned so it stays chosen (issue #3897).
 *
 * Three broad package gates were deliberately removed from the pull-request
 * workflow: the RSP build/unit/integration job, the whole `apps/redskilled`
 * suite, and the whole engine-package suite that `packages/red-castle` carried
 * before #4013 renamed it. **A removal nothing pins is a removal that grows
 * back** — the next worker who wants coverage adds the broad job again, and the
 * PR gate silently returns to the cost the repo decided against.
 *
 * The other half of the same decision is what REPLACED them: focused,
 * black-box, seconds-cheap suites. So this file asserts both directions at
 * once. A focused suite that disappears is as much a regression as a broad gate
 * that reappears, and neither is visible to a type checker.
