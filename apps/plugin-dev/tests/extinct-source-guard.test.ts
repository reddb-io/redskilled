/**
 * The extinction ratchet: a reader that reintroduces a Fleet or Attempt source
 * fails here, and so does a module or symbol merely NAMED for one (issue #2795,
 * issue #2850, Spec #2772, ADR 0130).
 *
 * Deleting the code was the crossing; this keeps it deleted. That migration is
 * over — no ADR 0130 location is tolerated — which is what promoted the ratchet
 * into the normal check set. Four properties are load-bearing: a new reference
 * FAILS and names its location, a NAME fails the same way a source does,
 * findings only ever DECREASE, and prose describing what was removed is
 * documentation rather than a reader.
 *
 * A SECOND crossing now rides the same ratchet — the execution chain of ADRs
 * 0147/0148/0149 (Spec #4007, issue #4009) — declared at today's counts BEFORE
 * its surfaces are deleted. Its own describe block is at the foot of this file.

 * THE SECOND CROSSING (ADRs 0147/0148/0149, Spec #4007, issue #4009). The first
 * one declared its inventory while deleting; this one declares it BEFORE, at
 * today's counts, because `red-skills-dev` still routes 36 commands, the dev
 * bundle is still a Worker body and the janitor still sweeps a human's checkout.
 * The `red-castle` specifier is the first debt paid: issue #4013 renamed the
 * package to `@reddb-io/worker` under `packages/worker`, clearing 72 declared
 * locations. Four properties are load-bearing: the
 * declared counts ARE the tree's counts, one extra reference at ANY declared
 * location reds the guard, each entry names the route that replaced it, and the
 * surfaces that SURVIVE the redesign are not reddened by mistake.
