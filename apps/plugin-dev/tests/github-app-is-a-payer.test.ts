/**
 * The App pays for reads; the operator signs the work.
 *
 * A GitHub App installation exists to keep automation off a person's rate
 * limit, and it earns that by touching only the READ client. The moment its
 * credential reaches the `gh` CLI — as `GH_TOKEN`, as `GITHUB_TOKEN`, or in any
 * exec environment — every comment, label and pull request the fleet creates is
 * signed by a bot instead of the operator, and every commit pushed through it
 * is attributed to an app nobody recognises.
 *
 * The separation is currently structural: reads go through the routed client
 * (`githubReadClient`), writes go through `runGithubWrite` into `gh`, and the
 * App credential is handed only to `createGithubClient`. Structure is not a
 * guarantee, though — one convenient assignment would undo it silently, and the
 * damage would appear in a repository's history rather than in a stack trace.
