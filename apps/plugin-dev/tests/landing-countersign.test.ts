/**
 * Entry point `afk-lifecycle-landing`: `doLanding` refuses a head nothing
 * judged (Ticket #4138, Spec #4129, ADR 0154).
 *
 * Its Countersign source, stated in `LAND_ENTRY_POINTS`, is the head this landing
 * is about to merge — the pinned `validatedBranchTip` when the caller has one,
 * otherwise the freshly resolved remote tip — so the tests below assert the
 * SUBJECT the gate was asked about, not merely that a gate was called. A
 * precondition that refuses correctly while asking about the wrong head is the
 * failure this ticket exists to close, wearing a green suite.
