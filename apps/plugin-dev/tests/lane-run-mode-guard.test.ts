/**
 * The lane-to-mode invariant: every lane the drain isolates declares the run
 * mode it implies, and the claim path is what enforces it (issue #3026,
 * Spec #3022).
 *
 * Three properties are load-bearing. The contract covers the castle's live
 * `laneIsolated` set in BOTH directions, so a NEW isolated lane cannot land
 * without stating its mode and a removed one cannot linger as fiction — that is
 * the drift the scout lane already suffered, its mode carried by one caller's
 * argv rather than by the pair itself. Every declared entry states WHY, because
 * a table of pairs nobody can read is one the next author overrides. And the
 * claim path actually consults the contract, because a table no enforcement
 * point imports is green by accident.
