// What an AFK Worker logs reaches the host, or reaches no surface at all (#3079).
//
// The publisher existed, was exported, was documented in HOST-NOTES.md as a
// working feature — and had ZERO callers, so `daemon.ts`'s `source: "heartbeat"`
// branch never ran for a registration-lane Worker. The last test in this file is
// the ratchet for exactly that: an exported publisher nobody calls is what let
// this ship, and a grep is the only check that can see it.
