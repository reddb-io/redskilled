// src-test-file-guard — a test file this package never runs is not coverage.

// `vitest.config.ts` includes `tests/**/*.test.ts` and the shared-layer suite,
// and nothing else. A `*.test.ts` written under `src/` therefore matches no glob
// in any vitest config in the repo: it is never collected, never executed, and
// never fails. Issue #3021 found three of them here — 385 LOC that had asserted
// nothing since the day they landed, while reading in review exactly like the
// coverage their subjects did have.
//
// This is a PACKAGE-LOCAL layout rule, not a repo-wide invariant, which is why
// it lives in the ordinary suite rather than in `REPO_INVARIANT_SUITES`: the
// same `src/**/*.test.ts` layout is CORRECT in `packages/worker`, whose
// config includes it (`packages/worker/vitest.config.ts:5`). What is wrong
// is a colocated test in a package whose config only collects `tests/`.
