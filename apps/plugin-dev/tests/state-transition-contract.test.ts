// state-transition-contract.test.ts — the transition-API contract lint (#2528,
// #2664, ADR 0122 rule 5).
//
// Engine code must not hand-roll issue STATE-ROLE label edits: every mutation
// that queues, parks, promotes, quarantines, or dependency-blocks an issue
// flows through `planTransition`/`applyTransition` so the one-state-role
// invariant is proven at plan time. This test scans the engine source for RAW
// label-writer call sites whose arguments mention a state-role label and fails
// on any site that is not in the explicit allowlist below.
//
// A raw writer is any of: `editLabels(`, the legacy `editLabelsTagged(`
// wrapper, a `gh issue edit --add-label/--remove-label` command line built in
// a .ts source, or a dispose-set literal (`addLabels: [...]`) that names a
// state role. Planner-backed wrappers (PLANNER_BACKED_WRAPPERS) are the
// transition API itself, not a bypass of it — a guard test below pins that
// each one still routes through the planner.
//
// Adding a NEW raw state-label edit fails this test by design — route it
// through the transition API, or (for a genuinely justified survivor: a
// documented legacy fallback, a non-issue surface like PR review labels, or a
// human/manual command surface) add it to the allowlist WITH a reason.
//
// This lint owns the HOST tree only. The planner itself lives in the Worker
// package's `engine/state-transition.ts` since #2666, and that tree is scanned by
// its own suite (`src/engine/state-transition-contract.test.ts`) with an
// EMPTY allowlist — never re-add those paths here.
