 * Field coverage for the `statusline_aggregate` MCP tool (#2344).

 * can render must be derivable from the tool payload, so an agent or UI can
 * rebuild the statusline from the MCP alone. Host-side blocks (the Claude Code
 * stdin payload: session model/effort, context %, usage quotas) are explicitly
 * out of scope — the tool must not fake them.
 *
 * The field lists are PARSED from `core/statusline.ts` rather than restated, so
 * adding a castle-side render field fails this test until the aggregate carries
 * it.
