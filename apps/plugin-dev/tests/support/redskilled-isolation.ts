/**
 * redskilled-isolation — "no daemon" is a fact about the SANDBOX, never about
 * the developer's machine (#2981, the rule #2884 established for the canary).
 *
 * A test that asserts a refusal from an absent daemon has to own the absence.
 * Resolved from the ambient environment, `resolveRedskilledPaths()` lands on the
 * operator's real socket, so `project_start` succeeded with `status: registered`
 * on every host that runs a daemon and the refusal assertion went red on
 * untouched code. Three files had already pinned their own scope by hand — the
 * canary sandbox, the MCP contract fixture, and redskilled's own offline
 * `--help` suite — which is three spellings of one boundary and a fourth waiting
 * to be forgotten. This module is the boundary for THIS package: imported once
 * as its vitest setup file, so every test in the suite inherits it and no new
 * one has to remember it. The canary's sandbox stays as it is — it pins the
 * environment of the child processes it launches, which no setup file can do.
 *
 * Six pins, and each closes a different way to the operator's host:
 *
 * 1. `REDSKILLED_SESSION` — the scope itself. A key nothing else uses means the
 *    derived socket is one no daemon on this machine is listening on.
 * 2. `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` — where that socket lives. Pinned so a suite does not
 *    deposit dead session directories in the operator's real runtime dir, which
 *    is the litter #2884 named.
 * 3. `REDSKILLED_MACHINE_DIR` — the machine claim. It lives in a SHARED
 *    directory by design, so an unpinned test reads the live claim of the
 *    operator's daemon and gets "the machine is held" instead of "nothing is
 *    there".
 * 4. `REDSKILLED_BIN` — the auto-spawn (ADR 0130 rule 7). Reaching a silent
 *    socket tries to START a daemon from the published bundle, so a host with a
 *    cached bundle would answer its own refusal test by launching the very
 *    daemon it is asserting the absence of. Pinned to a path that does not
 *    exist: the spawn fails immediately, by name, without a network fetch.
 *
 * 5. `HOME` — the host-scoped daemon home. The event lane, death lane and
 *    durable bundles live below `~/.red/redskilled`; leaving it ambient lets a
 *    sandbox daemon read and write the operator's real history.
 *
 * 6. `RED_DEV_ENGINE_FLOOR` — the dispatch engine floor (#3031). Its default
 *    policy makes every dispatch surface read the npm dist-tag, so an unpinned
 *    suite would put a NETWORK call behind `dispatchIssue` and let the
 *    operator's registry decide a unit test. Pinned `off`: a suite that means to
 *    exercise the floor states its own policy explicitly, which is the same
 *    "own the absence" rule the four pins above hold.
 * 7. `REDSKILLED_UNIT_DISCOVERY` — host unit adoption. A sandbox claim must not
 *    adopt the operator's real systemd Workers into its accounting or event lane.
 *
 * Every pin is an environment variable rather than an injected parameter,
 * because the leak is in the DEFAULT derivation — a test that had to remember to
 * inject is a test that can forget.
