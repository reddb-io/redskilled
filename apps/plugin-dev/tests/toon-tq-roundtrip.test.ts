/**
 * The host `tq` reader must never fall BEHIND the bundled encoder (ADR 0097). These tests are the
 * empirical half of that floor: they encode with the bundled library and decode with the installed
 * binary, so a format break between the two shows up as a red test rather than as an operator
 * blind to their own logs.
 *
 * A floor, not an equality — the danger runs one way only. A newer `tq` reads what an older
 * library wrote, which is how the format ships; demanding equality reddened on an operator whose
 * only act was to run the current release (#3466).
