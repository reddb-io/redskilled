// The sweep's silence used to be unreadable (#3801): a dependency gate stayed
// shut with every blocker closed, and `promoted: []` was the entire answer — so
// telling "no candidate carried the label" from "a blocker still reads open"
// from "the transition was refused" meant re-running the core by hand.
//
// Each case below is one of those silences, now spoken.
