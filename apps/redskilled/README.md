# redskilled

The host-scoped execution daemon of ADR 0130: **exactly one singleton per
machine, behind a unix socket**, owning Worker processes across every project on
that machine while each project's bundle keeps owning the work. A second OS user
on the same machine is refused by name rather than served or silently doubled
(Amendment 3).

The core exists, is reachable, honest about its own life — and **births Workers**:
a project hands over an argv, a placement target, a budget and two opaque
strings, and the daemon launches the Worker into a resource unit of its own.
**A restart costs none of it**: the daemon re-attaches to its live Workers by
unit name and rehydrates identity and budget from its own append-only event lane.

## Why its own app

The vendored `packages/worker` cannot *be* this daemon: every checkout
carries its own copy, so a host-scoped singleton living there would be N
singletons. The rsp core is repository-scoped and deliberately minimal, so the
daemon does not belong inside it either. It lives here and consumes the shared
resident infrastructure (`packages/shared/resident-core.ts`) rather than a copy
of it.

## Public host-event contract

An external program may watch `~/.red/redskilled/redskilled.log.toonl` for
exactly three public event kinds: `worker-birth`, `worker-death`, and
`worker-budget-kill`. Their kind membership and emitted field set are stable;
changing either is a public contract change guarded by
`tests/public-host-event-contract.test.ts`. Every other kind on the lane is
internal telemetry and may be added, removed, or reshaped without notice. A
consumer must ignore kinds outside the public set.

The lane is append-only within a generation and rotates atomically at 4 MiB.
Compaction keeps every live Worker's birth and the newest history that fits, so
daemon boot replays a fixed upper bound without losing a process it must
re-attach. Ordinary compaction targets 2 MiB, leaving about 2 MiB for subsequent
appends before another replacement. In steady state that is approximately one
byte rewritten by compaction per newly appended encoded byte, plus the append
itself, instead of a 4 MiB rewrite per event. A live-Worker birth baseline larger
than 2 MiB necessarily reduces that headroom but may never cross the 4 MiB hard
ceiling.

`tests/event-lane-rotation.test.ts` measures generation replacements rather than
wall-clock timing: after warmup, its representative 8 KiB lane and 120-byte
refusal details previously replaced the generation 40 times for 40 appends; the
regression bound is at most 8 replacements for those 40 appends. A reader may
start at the new generation's head: every public death and budget-kill repeats
the Worker's identity and can be understood without its birth.

A stateful consumer should use `readRedskilledEventsFrom` positions (or preserve
the same generation-and-offset semantics in another language). A position from
the replaced generation returns `rebaseline-required` together with everything
the current generation can show; it never silently treats the old byte offset as
current history. `followRedskilledPublicEvents` performs the recovery contract:
on first attach or a rotated position it captures the new position, asks
`host-state` for the current picture, and resumes event following from there.
The missing prefix is never replayed or guessed.

`host-state.topology` states the daemon's `platform` and whether its kernel is
`native` or `wsl`. WSL is detected from the kernel release, not from an
environment variable. On first attach, `followRedskilledPublicEvents` compares
that daemon-side fact with its own kernel and returns `status: refused` for
`wsl-daemon/native-windows-consumer` or
`native-windows-daemon/wsl-consumer`. The refusal names that file-change
notification does not cross the WSL boundary and returns no watch position.
WSL on both sides and native Windows on both sides remain ordinary `baseline`
attachments.

Each public record is flat and total. It contains the following fields, with
`null` used where a field does not apply:

```text
admission_verdict  base_commits_ahead  base_head_sha  cpu_weight  detail
event  exit_code  fork_sha  heal_kind  isolated  kind  log_path  memory_high
memory_max  model  phase  pid  project_label  reason  runner  signal  step
tokens  tools  ts  unit  version  worker_id  workspace_path
```

`kind` is the discriminator; `event` carries the same value as its compatibility
alias. All three kinds carry the Worker's identity and placement fields, so a
consumer can handle a death or budget kill even after the corresponding birth
has rotated out of the lane. Kind-specific facts are `admission_verdict` on a
birth and `detail`, `exit_code`, `signal`, and `reason` on a death or budget
kill.

### Operator-scoped event sinks

The same three public lifecycle kinds may fire programs declared in the
operator-owned `~/.red/config.yaml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  dev:
    redskilled:
      hooks:
        worker-birth:
          argv: [/usr/local/bin/redwall, refresh]
          env:
            REDWALL_MODE: live
      notifications:
        - worker-death
        - worker-budget-kill
```

Each hook is asynchronous and receives the complete host-state
JSON document on standard input. `REDSKILLED_HOST_EVENT` names the
triggering kind. The snapshot is taken after the triggering lifecycle change
and before the sink itself is born, so a Worker-count consumer never counts its
own refresh process.

Hooks are ordinary host-owned Workers under the synthetic
`redskilled/host-events` project: admission, host ceilings, placement, event-lane
accounting, and teardown all apply. A full host may therefore refuse a hook
without changing the triggering Worker. Sink Worker events never recurse into
the machine policy.

`notifications` uses the native desktop command for the daemon platform
(`notify-send`, `osascript`, or PowerShell) and receives the same state document.
The declarations are read at every daemon start from machine policy, never from
the daemon-written registration snapshot, so they survive restarts and remain
operator-owned.

## What it owns

| Concern | Where it lives |
| --- | --- |
| Which session a daemon serves | `src/paths.ts` — session key, socket, lock, lease |
| Who owns the session across restarts | `src/session-lease.ts` — pid + start time, TOON on disk |
| Who owns the socket right now | `src/daemon.ts` — exclusive bind |
| The frozen wire contract | `src/protocol.ts` — `ping`, `host-state`, `statusline-payload`, `statusline-string`, `worker-start`, `worker-command`, `worker-heartbeat`, `shutdown` |
| Who may read and who may write | `src/session-reach.ts` — read the host, write the project |
| What this machine is doing, in one document | `src/statusline-payload.ts` — Workers, projects, vitals, budgets, staleness |
| That same answer, as a finished line | `src/statusline-render.ts` — modes, degradation, width; a pure function of the payload |
| The declared defaults and the flag above them | `src/statusline-config.ts` — `plugins.dev.statusline.*`, resolved client-side |
| A Worker's last logged line, published not read | `src/worker-log.ts` — the heartbeat's opaque string, and the restart-only recovery |
| Where a Worker's resources are charged | `src/worker-placement.ts` — pure planner over injected probes |
| Birth itself | `src/worker-launch.ts` — plan, spawn once, report the downgrade |
| The host-wide read | `src/host-state.ts` — total shape, Workers plus the budget total |
| What the daemon remembers across a restart | `src/event-lane.ts` — bounded TOONL generations: Worker lifecycle, metric observations, and the daemon's own stop |
| What a stop is giving up | `src/daemon-stop.ts` — the pure report: what is held, what survives, why it stopped |
| Finding the Workers a restart left running | `src/reattach.ts` — the unit name first, the pid only as fallback |
| Finding processes a crashed daemon left outside its Worker set | `src/orphan-reaper.ts` — pure candidate selection, `/proc` census, PID-reuse guard |
| What the host has been promised | `src/budget-accounting.ts` — pure totals over the Worker set |
| Reaching the daemon | `src/client.ts` — never starts one; fails closed with the repair hint |
| Starting the daemon | `src/daemon-birth.ts` — the provisioner's own start, through the service when there is one |
| Which file a start runs | `src/daemon-entry.ts` — the published bundle by name, never the caller's own entry |
| Reviving a daemon nobody asked for | `src/supervision.ts` — the always-on user unit, `Restart=always` |
| Becoming the version that is published | `src/self-replace.ts` — decide, find the successor, hand the session over |
| The home, and the route to a reachable daemon | `src/provision.ts` — the ONE creator of `~/.red/redskilled/`, the pure provisioning audit, and the user unit |
| Clearing the sessions that died | `src/reclaim.ts` — the lease decides, another tool's directory is left alone |

## Behaviours worth knowing

- **The start race resolves twice.** The spawn lock stops N clients launching N
  processes; the exclusive bind stops the ones that slip past from both
  believing they own the socket. The loser waits and connects to the winner — it
  never fails.
- **A spawn runs the published bundle, and refuses rather than fall back.** The
  entry is resolved by name — `REDSKILLED_BIN`, the caller's entry *only when it
  is itself a redskilled entry*, then the bundle shipped beside a host, the repo
  `dist/`, the workspace, the installed package, the bundle cache — and an
  unresolvable bundle throws `RedskilledDaemonEntryError` naming every path it
  probed. Re-executing the caller's own entry is the defect this repository has
  already fixed twice (#2736, #2677): the launcher's version becomes the
  daemon's, so a stale caller mints a staler daemon and the skew widens.
- **No host answered is not the host answering nothing.** Every failure to reach
  the daemon — an unresolvable bundle, a spawn that never bound, a socket that
  died mid-request — surfaces as `RedskilledUnreachableError` carrying its cause.
  An operator reading an empty host state must be reading an idle machine, never
  a failed lookup.
- **A pid is not an identity.** The lease pins `pid` *and* `start_time`, so a
  former process whose pid the OS reused cannot renew or release the current
  holder's lease. A crash leaves the record behind on purpose; the next acquirer
  reaps it.
- **Idle exit is gated on Workers.** The daemon rearms instead of exiting while
  it believes a Worker is alive (ADR 0130 rule 7).
- **Fail closed.** No daemon, no Worker. A client that cannot reach the daemon
  throws; there is no quiet local fallback, because for a launcher failing open
  costs the machine.
- **The daemon receives paths, never derives them.** No marker file is looked
  for, no parent directory walked, no layout assumed. That is what lets one
  daemon serve checkouts pinned to different bundle versions.
- **A transient service unit, never a scope.** A scope runs inside the caller's
  unit and cannot outlive it, so every Worker would die with the daemon that
  asked for it. A service unit is owned by the init system, which is what later
  lets the daemon restart without taking every project's work down with it.
- **Placement is decided at launch.** Moving a running process between resource
  groups does not move its existing memory charge, so a Worker born in the
  caller's group stays charged there for life no matter what is done afterwards.
- **A restart re-attaches, it does not restart the work.** The daemon replays its
  event lane, asks the host about each Worker by unit name, adopts the ones still
  running and records the deaths of the ones that ended while nobody was
  watching. A pid is only consulted for a Worker that never got a unit.
- **A death is the host's answer, never the launch client's exit.** Under the
  transient-unit backend the process the daemon watches is `systemd-run --wait`,
  standing beside the unit rather than being it — and the daemon's own teardown
  kills that client while the Worker keeps running. Writing the exit onto the lane
  as a death is what let a live Worker escape the budget permanently (#2917):
  every successor replayed the death and adopted nothing. An exit is now resolved
  against the unit before it is believed, and the pid the daemon then watches is
  the unit's own, because a budget sampled through a reclaimed pid is unmeasured.
- **A birth is acknowledged only once it is on the lane.** The client is told its
  Worker exists after the record reaches disk, so a daemon replaced a millisecond
  later cannot leave a live Worker whose birth nothing wrote — and a signalled
  daemon stops rather than being cut off, flushing the lane on its way out.
- **The lane is this daemon's memory; the host is the machine's.** A start also
  asks the init system for the Worker units no lane accounts for and adopts them,
  named as unowned rather than left invisible: an unheld Worker is room the next
  admission believes the machine has and it does not. Only the daemon holding the
  machine-wide claim sweeps — a second instance adopting the arbiter's Workers
  would be the same accounting hole from the other side — and
  `REDSKILLED_UNIT_DISCOVERY=off` declines the sweep outright.
- **Stamped process orphans are reconciled on their own five-minute census.**
  Only the machine-claim arbiter runs it. A reparented process carrying
  `RED_WORKER_ID` is adopted when its event-lane birth is still live; without a
  live birth it receives a ten-minute grace, is recorded as an adopted birth,
  and is then stopped as a whole process group. The leader's `/proc` starttime
  must still match the census immediately before signalling, so pid reuse costs
  the reap rather than a stranger. An unstamped process under a canonical Worker
  lane is reported after thirty minutes and is never signalled. Set
  `REDSKILLED_ORPHAN_REAPER=report` to withhold no-birth orphan adoption and
  teardown while retaining reports (live births are still reattached), or
  `REDSKILLED_ORPHAN_REAPER=off` to skip the census.
- **Host facts share one lane.** Worker lifecycle and cumulative metric
  observations are daemon-owned and live in the same append-only TOONL lane.
  The observations retain enough counter history to reconstruct the dashboard's
  48 UTC-hour token and Ticket series after restart; issue-to-PR stays with the
  tracker and branch-to-commits stays with git.
- **A crash costs the event in flight, never the lane.** An unterminated final
  line is read as absent (TOONL's own rule for a truncated open tail) and dropped
  before the next append, so a half-written record can never fuse onto the next.
- **Reach is asymmetric: read the host, write the project.** A session reads
  every project's Workers, because diagnosing contention from wherever you happen
  to be is the problem the daemon exists to solve. Dispatch, stop, recycle and
  steer are refused into any project but the session's own — these sessions are
  largely driven by autonomous agents that do not understand a repository they
  were not started in. A refusal never distinguishes "no such Worker" from "not
  your Worker", so a session cannot map another project by guessing.
- **Staleness travels inside the payload.** The daemon measures on its own tick
  and dates the answer itself, so a consumer renders the age rather than
  re-deriving it — which is what stops two surfaces from reporting different
  answers about the same instant. A tick that failed to read the host ages the
  payload instead of refreshing it, and an unmeasured Worker is `null` and named,
  never a zero that reads as idle.
- **The string is a pure function of the payload.** Two surfaces exist because a
  host wants a line and a UI wants structure; purity is what stops them becoming
  two answers. The daemon renders the string from the very payload the other op
  returns, and a test proves the daemon's line equals `renderRedskilledStatusline`
  over the payload read beside it — so **no agent host renders anything**: it runs
  the daemon's `statusline` command and prints what comes back.
- **The default mode is the local project; `global` is the whole machine.** The
  common case is one operator in one repository, so the quiet default lists only
  that project's Workers. `global` lists every project's and names the owner of
  each — an anonymous Worker on a busy machine is what the mode exists to fix.
- **A crowded machine degrades, it never overflows.** When the Workers do not fit
  the count budget or the width, the line drops to one entry per project; when
  the projects do not fit either, it drops to the host total. Detail is lost on
  purpose and the loss is stated (`detail`, `degraded`) rather than left to be
  detected by re-parsing the line. The full picture stays with the dashboard and
  the monitor.
- **The live TTY is a real responsive table.** The shared renderer publishes an
  operational column hierarchy on terminals at least 110 columns wide and a
  grouped Worker/Work/State/Activity hierarchy below that. Tuiuiu paints the
  declared table; pipe output stays the stable one-shot text snapshot.
- **`--verbose` adds a second line per Worker, and the Worker supplies it.** The
  Worker publishes its last logged line on its heartbeat (`worker-heartbeat`) as an
  opaque string; the daemon stores and returns it without ever parsing it, so the
  whole global verbose view is still ONE read and opens no project's files. A
  statusline that read each Worker's log itself would cost a disk read per Worker
  per render, cross a project boundary, and hand every surface a private source.
  A Worker that has logged nothing gets no second line at all.
- **A restart is the one time the daemon reads a log — from the path it was given.**
  A daemon that just came back holds Workers it has heard no heartbeat from, so for
  those it reads once, using the `log_path` the client handed over at spawn and the
  event lane carried through. A Worker whose client gave no path waits for its next
  heartbeat; guessing a filename inside its workspace would be the derived layout
  rule 3 forbids. Recovery is not the normal path, and the payload says which lines
  came from it (`log.source`).
- **Defaults are declared once, in `plugins.dev.statusline.*`.** `mode`,
  `max_workers`, `max_projects`, `max_width` and `verbose`; a flag beats config, config
  beats the built-in. Config is read **client-side** — the daemon may not know
  what a `.red/config.yaml` is — so only decided values cross the socket. A
  malformed value is named on stderr and ignored, never fatal: this line renders
  on every turn, and a blank statusline is the harder failure to diagnose.
- **The daemon is always on, and no client starts one** (ADR 0150 §4). `provision`
  writes a user unit whose `ExecStart` is the one serve argv every start path
  builds — one builder, so a flag cannot reach one start path and miss the other
  — plus `Restart=always`, which revives a daemon after either a failed or clean
  exit. The unit is the sole birth authority: a cold client asks systemd to start
  it, and a client that finds neither daemon nor unit raises
  `RedskilledNotProvisionedError` carrying the one repair sentence rather than
  launching a process of its own. There is no idle exit and no idle knob — an
  idle daemon handed the next client's bundle the choice of which daemon a whole
  machine ran (ADR 0143). Restart bursts are bounded (`5` starts per `60`
  seconds), so a stale holder becomes a visible failed unit rather than an
  unbounded storm. A host with no `systemd --user` session is provisioned
  directly instead; the binary, the socket and the contract are identical.
- **A superseded daemon replaces itself, and a Worker never notices.** The daemon
  resolves the published version on its own tick and, when a newer one exists,
  finds a successor that runs *exactly that version*, flushes the lane, lets go
  of the socket and the lease, and starts it. Under a supervisor it first writes
  and reloads an atomic `ExecStart` drop-in for that resolved successor, then exits
  with a distinct non-zero code so `Restart=always` cannot revive a stale entry. Workers are init-system units, so
  this is a restart and not an evacuation: the successor re-adopts every one of
  them off the lane. A published bundle this host cannot reach costs the upgrade
  and nothing else, because the successor is found *before* anything is given up.
- **The version it reports is the version it runs.** The published answer travels
  beside the running one (`upgrade.published_version` next to `daemon_version`),
  never folded into it, and an unresolvable read stays `published_unknown` rather
  than becoming a match — a manufactured zero skew is exactly how a stale process
  looks current while every Worker halts on the version it claimed to measure.
- **A major boundary is held, and the hold is said out loud.** The self-replacement
  only ever resolves inside the running major, because a breaking change must not
  arrive on a machine that is holding Workers just because a timer noticed it. The
  hold is reported rather than kept: `upgrade.newest_published_version` names the
  newest release whatever its major, `upgrade.major_held` is 1 while one is being
  withheld, and `upgrade.major_hold` carries the reason and the manual step that
  crosses it — re-pointing the unit under supervision, stopping this daemon
  without one. A silent hold is indistinguishable from being current, which is how
  an operator who updated the plugin to a new major and saw nothing change was
  left with no surface to ask (#2926). A daemon that is genuinely current, one
  merely behind inside its major, and one whose probe resolved nothing all report
  no hold at all.
- **Stop is asked for, never signalled.** The `stop` command reports the Workers
  and projects the daemon is holding, states that every one of them survives —
  they are init-system units, so a stop is a restart and not an evacuation — and
  writes the intent to the event lane BEFORE the operator is told, so a successor
  replaying the lane can tell a planned handover from a crash. A signal reaches
  the same code and records itself as a signal; the reason is a field, not a
  sentence to parse. A socket nobody answers on is a success with a stated reason:
  the operator asked for a machine with no daemon on it and that is what they have.
- **Every Worker is born under a stated ceiling, and no knob states it.** A client
  that declares a budget gets exactly that budget; a client that declares none is
  not left uncapped. The daemon derives the ceiling from the accounting it already
  keeps — the host memory ceiling shared across its Worker slots when an operator
  declared a count, capped at the headroom the live Workers' declared budgets
  leave — and hands it to the placement as the scope's `MemoryMax`. The derived
  number is a wall, never memory set aside: it does not enter the admission charge,
  so one Worker cannot spend the host's whole accounting and have the next one
  refused. Host memory pressure then kills the Worker that earned it instead of
  the terminal's biggest bystander, and **the Worker can name what held it**: the
  scope, its ceiling, and — when the host could scope nothing — the degradation,
  are handed down in the Worker's own environment (`RED_WORKER_SCOPE`,
  `RED_WORKER_MEMORY_CEILING`, `RED_WORKER_SCOPE_DEGRADATION`) and land on the
  death record it writes on the way out.
- **An unisolated launch is never silent.** When the host affords no transient
  unit the Worker still starts, and the reply — and the host-state record it
  keeps for its whole life — carries a warning naming what was lost. A declared
  budget that cannot be enforced says so as its own warning.
- **WSL2 is supported; WSL1 is not.** WSL2 is a Linux host missing the two things
  the Linux path prefers, and each has a stated degradation rather than a
  failure: with no `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` the socket lands under `tmpdir()` and the
  session is scoped `uid:<n>`, and with no `systemd-run` and no `--user` session
  the Worker is born **unisolated**, carrying the warning that names what was
  lost. The memory ceiling is then the daemon's own RSS sampling floor and
  nothing else, which is why that floor is uniform across backends. **A
  memory-pressure kill on such a host lands on the whole session**, not on one
  Worker — plan the host budget accordingly. WSL1 is excluded because the floor
  walks the Worker's process tree through `/proc`, which WSL2 has and WSL1 does
  not: there the ceiling would silently have nothing to read. A long `TMPDIR` —
  WSL and some distros relocate it — falls back once more to `/tmp` so the socket
  path stays inside the kernel's 108-byte `sun_path` limit.

## Which identity pays

Each Project binds to one named, daemon-owned credential profile. The implicit
profile is `personal`, preserving the existing precedence:
`REDSKILLED_HOST_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, then `gh auth token`.
The daemon re-runs that lookup when a Project asks for GitHub access; it never
copies the credential into Project config, an ACP/MCP request, or a Worker.

Named backends live only in the host's `~/.red/config.yaml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  dev:
    redskilled:
      github_profiles:
        personal:
          kind: personal
        engineering:
          kind: github-app
          app_id: "4575633"
          installation_id: "153309957"
          private_key: ~/.red/redskilled/credentials/engineering.pem
```

A tracked Project selects only the public name:

```yaml
plugins:
  dev:
    github:
      credential_profile: engineering
```

The App's PEM stays daemon-local. `redskilled` reads it and mints a fresh
installation credential at use, so key and installation-token rotation do not
expose material downstream. Several profiles may coexist; cache entries,
in-flight reads, returned budget facts, and authorization decisions are keyed by
profile as well as Project.

Profiles are fail-closed. An unknown name, missing or invalid credential, or
scope mismatch returns a typed, secret-free ACP refusal. An explicitly selected
App never falls back to `personal`; fix its installation or permissions instead.

## Provisioning

A daemon starts on first use. Two things must exist before it can — a published
bundle to run and a socket that answers — and one command establishes both,
prints the audit, and is what `/red-setup` (Section E3) runs:

```bash
# The npm direct-run form is canonical (ADR 0091): it pins the version and works
# on every host, including the one that has never seen this daemon. An installed
# `redskilled` shim on PATH is a warm-cache optimization, never a requirement.
RS="npx -y -p @reddb-io/red-skills@<version> red-skills-redskilled"

$RS provision                  # start the daemon, print the audit
$RS provision --check          # the read-only half — creates nothing, starts nothing
$RS provision --workspace host # a lane under the home: provision the home too
$RS provision --no-unit        # skip the OS service; keep the host's own arrangement
```

- **The daemon owns its state home.** The socket and lease stay in the session
  runtime directory; the durable event/narrative lane and registration-intent
  snapshot are host-scoped under `~/.red/redskilled/`. A successor therefore
  restores the same project drains even if XDG availability changes its socket
  directory. The daemon creates that private home
  on first append, and `provision` may create it earlier. Host policy remains in
  the sibling `~/.red/config.yaml`. A workspace lane rooted inside the home
  (`plugins.dev.workspace.target: host`, or a custom parent under it) uses the
  same owner-provisioned directory. Selecting the `host` preset provisions it,
  and the receipt names the declaration (`needed_by`) that asked for it.
- **The home is this app's.** `~/.red/redskilled/` is operator-scoped and sits
  outside every checkout, so it is not the `.red/` ADR 0067 gave `/red-setup`
  sole authority over. `redskilled` creates it through its provisioner or its
  canonical log writer (ADR 0130 Amendment 2); every surface reads the one namer in
  `packages/shared/redskilled-home.ts`. Deciding *when* to call it changes
  nothing about *who* calls it.
- **Idempotent by construction.** An existing home is kept with everything in
  it, and the only thing a second run can change is a permission bit that
  drifted wider than owner-only — a repair, not a rewrite. Provisioning creates
  the initial `~/.red/config.yaml` template when absent and never overwrites an
  operator's existing file.
- **The audit is pure, and the doctor consumes it.** `/red-doctor` renders the
  same four checks (`home`, `daemon-entry`, `reach`, `supervisor-unit`) from
  `auditRedskilledProvisioning` over injected facts, probing the socket
  **without spawning** the daemon it reports on. An absent home is two states,
  not one: absent-and-unneeded is `ok` with the declaration that says so, and
  only absent-and-needed is a finding.
- **The unit is the birth authority.** It adds `Restart=always` over the same
  binary, socket and contract every start path uses, and is the only way the
  daemon is born on a host that can hold one. An absent unit is
  reported as `ok`. An installed and enabled but inactive unit is reported as a
  finding. An existing unit file is never rewritten by provisioning; an in-major
  self-replacement atomically overrides only `ExecStart` through a managed drop-in.

### Host-wide daemon policy

Machine limits belong only in the operator's home config; the same keys in a
repository `.red/config.yaml` are warned about and ignored:

```yaml
plugins:
  dev:
    redskilled:
      worker_ceiling: 6
      memory_ceiling: 8G
      validation_ceiling: 2
      evidence_ttl_ms: 2592000000
```

Resolution is `serve` flag > environment > home config > derived default.
The ceiling flags are `--worker-ceiling` and `--memory-ceiling`; their environment
counterparts are `REDSKILLED_WORKER_CEILING` and `REDSKILLED_MEMORY_CEILING`.
`validation_ceiling` (or `REDSKILLED_VALIDATION_CEILING`) sizes the host-wide
full-suite semaphore. When absent, its capacity is the tightest of half the
available CPU count, the resolved memory ceiling in 2 GiB shares, and the
Worker ceiling; every dimension retains a minimum capacity of one.
`evidence_ttl_ms` (or `REDSKILLED_EVIDENCE_TTL_MS`) is how long a dead Worker's
evidence lane under `~/.red/tmp/workers/<id>/` survives — its log, the runner's
session artifact and the daemon's verdict — and defaults to thirty days. `0`
keeps nothing; a live Worker's lane is never pruned at any TTL. The daemon's own
log stays in `~/.red/redskilled/`, which this TTL never touches. `host-state`
reports the resolved `ceiling` and the `memory_source` / `worker_source` that won,
so a restart or a service start remains directly auditable.

### Counters, and where they may be pushed

The daemon counts what its own event lane already records — Worker births,
Worker deaths and budget kills by project label, its own decisions by kind — plus
the public Workflow turns it served, by outcome. An administrative ACP endpoint
reads them as a cumulative snapshot through the `metrics` extension method; an
ordinary project-scoped connection is refused, because the counters are
host-wide and their labels would name every other project on the machine.

Exporting them is **off by default**: with no block below, the daemon starts with
no receiver, no timer and no outbound socket. Naming an endpoint turns it on.

```yaml
plugins:
  dev:
    redskilled:
      telemetry:
        otlp:
          endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:4318
          interval_ms: 60000
          headers:
            authorization: Bearer <collector token>
```

`endpoint` is the only key that enables anything — an interval or headers with no
endpoint is a cadence for nowhere and stays off. The base URL gains `/v1/metrics`
unless it already ends in it, every series is exported as a cumulative monotonic
sum in OTLP/HTTP JSON, and a push is a notification rather than a veto: a
collector that is down, slow or hostile changes nothing about the Workers this
daemon is running.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm -C apps/redskilled test        # the focused suite
pnpm -C apps/redskilled typecheck
pnpm -C apps/redskilled serve       # run the daemon on this session's socket
```

Every operator command below rides the same canonical prefix (ADR 0091):

```bash
RS="npx -y -p @reddb-io/red-skills@<version> red-skills-redskilled"
```

```bash
$RS stop                             # stop the daemon; print what survives it
$RS stop --reason "moving to 3.0.3"  # the words ride onto the event lane
```

```bash
$RS statusline                       # this project's Workers
$RS statusline global                # every project's, each showing its owner
$RS statusline --max-width 60        # a flag overrides the declared default
$RS statusline global --verbose      # each Worker plus the last line it logged
$RS statusline --no-verbose          # one read without the second lines
```

```bash
$RS unit status                      # is a supervisor installed? (absent is fine)
$RS unit install                     # write the user unit and enable it now
$RS unit uninstall                   # remove it; nothing starts the daemon afterwards
```

```bash
$RS reclaim --dry-run                # what a sweep would take, and why
$RS reclaim                          # remove the runtime dirs whose owner is gone
$RS reclaim --grace-ms 60000         # how old a lease-less dir must be to count
```

```bash
$RS reap --report                     # process/dump census; no host mutation
$RS reap                              # run the stamped-orphan sweep immediately
```

`reap --report` returns counts for active Worker units, daemon-held Workers,
stamped orphans, unstamped suspects, and crash dump files over the daemon
protocol. Report mode adopts nothing, signals nothing, and deletes nothing.
Without `--report`, only stamped orphans can be reaped; unstamped suspects and
dump files remain detection-only evidence.

## Reclaiming dead sessions

A daemon that crashes leaves its runtime directory behind: a socket nothing
listens on, a lease naming a pid that died, an event lane nobody will rehydrate.
The `reclaim` command sweeps both runtime parents — the `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` one and
the `tmpdir()` fallback — and reports every directory it looked at.

- **The lease decides, not the directory.** A dead pid in a lease is proof the
  holder is gone; nothing else on disk proves anything. A lease naming a live
  pid keeps its directory whatever else it contains.
- **A directory with no lease is only a corpse once it is stale.** A daemon
  mid-spawn has made its directory but not yet won its lease, so a lease-less
  directory younger than the grace window is reported `young` and kept — as is
  one whose socket still answers.
- **The runtime parent is shared, so foreignness is judged by name.** `rsp`'s
  resident sockets live under the same `red-skills/` parent. Only `redskilled.*`
  files are this sweep's business; a directory holding anything else is reported
  `foreign` and left alone.
- **The report is the point.** An operator reaching for this is usually
  mid-diagnosis — "which of these is a live daemon" is the question — so the
  sweep names every directory and its reason, and `--dry-run` is that same report
  with nothing removed.
