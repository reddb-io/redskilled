// acp-body-control-cut — ADR 0148's one rule, declared so both sides are checkable.
//
//   WHAT RUNS INSIDE THE WORKER IS THE BODY, and lives in `@reddb-io/worker`.
//   WHETHER, WHEN AND WHERE A WORKER EXISTS IS THE CONTROL PLANE, and stays
//   behind `redskilled`.
//
// The rule reads as obvious and drifts anyway, because the two halves meet in
// the middle of single files. `acp-native-worker.ts` held both: the function
// that DECIDED a Worker should exist and the function the resulting process
// RAN, one after the other, importing each other's neighbours. Nothing in a
// type checker can tell those apart — both compile, both pass their tests, and
// the seam is invisible until someone reaches across it.
//
// So the cut is DATA, checked in both directions by
// `apps/redskilled/tests/acp-body-control-cut.test.ts`:
//
//   1. A body module the daemon still holds FAILS — by its old name coming
//      back under `apps/redskilled/src/`, or by any daemon module DEFINING a
//      symbol the body owns. Re-exporting one is fine and deliberate: the
//      daemon's `acp-worker` entry is still the daemon's entry, it just loads
//      the body from the package.
//   2. A control-plane surface the package reaches for FAILS. Admission,
//      budget authority, placement, the session journal and the GitHub gateway
//      are the five the Worker most plausibly wants and may never have,
//      because each is an answer about OTHER Workers or about credentials the
//      Worker is not trusted with.
//   3. An UNDECLARED module under `packages/worker/src/acp/` FAILS, so the
//      inventory cannot quietly stop being one.
//
// Names are pinned by IDENTIFIER, never by the word. A Worker running out of
// budget checkpoints itself in `budget-grace.ts`, and that is body: the daemon
// decided the verdict, set the deadline and performs the kill.
