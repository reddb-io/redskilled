/**
 * acp-demand-turn — the daemon's own turn, for a Worker nobody is watching.
 *
 * **A birth nobody speaks to does nothing.** The demand loop births a process
 * for each unit of queue demand and then never prompts it, while every client
 * turn goes through admission → session → prompt (`acp-worker-admission.ts`,
 * `acp-worker-lifecycle.ts`). That gap is the whole reason a registered,
 * draining project produced Workers and no work (Spec #4097, #4100).
 *
 * This runs the same admission and the same turn with **no client on the other
 * end**: its own session map, its own synthetic session id, and a sink that
 * records lifecycle where a client would have been notified. It deliberately
 * does not borrow a connection's session map — an unattended turn that lived
 * inside a client's would die when that client disconnected, which is the one
 * property a drain must not have (#3885).
 *
 * The daemon still reads nothing: the prompt is a project-authored string with
 * the daemon's own facts expanded into it, exactly as the argv already was.
