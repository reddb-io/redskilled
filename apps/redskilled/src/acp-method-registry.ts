// acp-method-registry — one table, one module per `_redskills/*` domain.
//
// The control plane used to bind every extension method itself, twice: once on
// the v1 app and once on the v2 app, as two hand-kept chains of `.onRequest`.
// Two chains is the shape a method goes missing from — a binding added to one
// and forgotten on the other is a method that answers on one dialect and 404s
// on the other, and nothing fails until a peer that speaks the other dialect
// asks. So the bindings become DATA: each domain module declares its own, the
// table composes them, and both dialects are registered from the same list.
//
// A domain also declares the `_meta.redskills` fragment it contributes to
// `initialize`, because advertising a method the endpoint does not bind (and
// binding one it never advertises) are the same drift in the other direction.
