// acp-worktree — the daemon side of `worktree_add` and `worktree_list` (ADR 0150 §4).
//
// The interactive Working mode is the one a human returns to, so its worktree
// stays under the client checkout's manual lane rather than moving into the
// daemon's own storage. What moves is WHO creates it: the daemon, into a lane
// it names, forked from a trunk it fetched — not a hand-typed `git worktree
// add` whose base resolves to a LOCAL ref that can trail the remote, which is
// how work gets built on a stale tip and only the refused push says so.
//
// `worktree_list` is the other half, and the reason the pair is one slice: an
// interactive worktree lives in the client checkout and a Worker's lives in the
// daemon's storage (ADR 0149), so before this there was no single question that
// could be asked about both. Two half-inventories is the shape a worktree is
// forgotten in.
