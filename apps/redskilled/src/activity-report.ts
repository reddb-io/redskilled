/**
 * activity-report — the stored poll, dated for whoever reads it.
 *
 * **Fetching and dating are two domains.** `repository-activity` spends the
 * request: it holds the token condition, the conditional-list plumbing and the
 * rules about what a 304, a spent quota and an unreachable repository each mean.
 * Nothing here talks to GitHub. This module takes the document that poll stored
 * and answers one question — how old is it, and may it be presented as current.
 *
 * **Staleness travels inside the payload.** A surface that dated the answer
 * itself would need the poll interval, the daemon's clock and its own read
 * latency, and would get it subtly wrong in a different way per surface. The age
 * is a field, and rendering it is the whole of a consumer's job.
 *
 * `remote-counters` is this module's sibling, not its replacement: this dates the
 * POLL, which is what tells an operator whether the daemon still reaches GitHub,
 * and that dates each COUNTER, which is what a line rendering several numbers
 * side by side needs (ADR 0141).
 *
 * PURE.

 * interval is the jitter of a busy host or a slow API, and two is a poller that
 * stopped.
 *
 * A factor rather than only a constant, because the cadence it multiplies is no
 * longer one number: a presence-driven poll runs at two windows (ADR 0141), and
 * a threshold pinned to the tight one would mark every counter on an idle host
 * stale — reporting a poller that is working exactly as asked as one that broke.
 * The daemon states the window in force; this is the default for a caller that
