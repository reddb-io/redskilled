/**
 * admission — may this host afford one more Worker, right now?
 *
 * The defect ADR 0130 exists to fix is a static per-repository answer: every
 * checkout reads the same host capability profile, concludes the machine affords
 * N Workers, and spends that budget alone, so three projects on one machine run
 * 3N. **Admission is a decision over live process state, never over a stored
 * profile** — the denominator is the Worker set the daemon is holding at this
 * instant, across every project, which is the one number no per-repository read
 * can produce.
 *
 * The shape follows `evaluateHostGateAdmission` in red-castle deliberately: a
 * pure function, a boolean, and a named verdict. What is new here is the live
 * denominator and the fact that the verdict carries the numbers it judged on —
 * a refusal a caller cannot explain to an operator is a refusal that gets
 * disabled.
 *
 * **A Worker's charge is the largest amount it may take**, `MemoryMax` when it
 * declares one and `MemoryHigh` otherwise: `MemoryHigh` is throttling pressure,
 * not a wall, so admitting against it would let the host commit past a ceiling
 * the kernel is willing to exceed.
 *
 * PURE: every input is passed in; {@link resolveHostCeiling} is the one place
 * that reads the environment, and even that takes the host's memory as an
 * argument.
