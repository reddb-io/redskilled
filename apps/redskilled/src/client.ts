/**
 * client — how a project reaches `redskilled`.
 *
 * **No client ever spawns the daemon** (ADR 0150 §4). The daemon is an OS
 * service `provision` installs, so a cold client's whole repertoire is: answer
 * on the socket, follow the machine claim to the daemon that owns this host,
 * wait out a holder that is mid-boot, or ask the INSTALLED unit to start — and
 * when none of those produces a daemon, fail closed with the one repair
 * sentence. Client auto-spawn was ADR 0143's "resident by accident": whichever
 * bundle a client happened to carry decided which daemon the machine ran.
 *
 * ADR 0130 rule 6: fail closed. A daemon that is not there is a thrown error,
 * never a quiet local fallback — for a launcher, failing open costs the machine.
