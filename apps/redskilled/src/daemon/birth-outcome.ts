// birth-outcome — what a dead Worker REPORTED, and how that folds into its
// project's birth breaker.
//
// The breaker asks one question: can a Worker boot HERE. A Worker that booted,
// read the queue, found nothing eligible and said so answered it with a yes —
// and until #4048 the daemon counted that answer as a loss, because the only
// thing it read about a death was how long the Worker lived. On 2026-08-19 a
// drained queue emptied three Workers within seconds of birth, the latch armed,
// and every birth that would have consumed the queue once it was repaired was
// refused until an operator cleared the latch by hand.
//
// So a death now carries an OUTCOME CLASS beside its lifetime. The vocabulary is
// three words of the Worker protocol's own `<promise>` sentinel — never a
// repository's account of its work (ADR 0130 rule 3): this module learns THAT a
// Worker finished, never what it finished.
