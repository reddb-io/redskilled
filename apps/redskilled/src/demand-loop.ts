/**
 * demand-loop — the daemon decides WHEN to ask for the next Worker, not only
 * whether one may be born.
 *
 * ADR 0130 Amendment 4 closes a gap the producer left open. A per-project
 * runtime had to accept a smaller grant without arguing, because *"the host is
 * the only authority that can see every project at once"* — and a component that
 * defers on **how many** Workers exist while independently deciding **when** to
 * ask is deferring on the half it can see and insisting on the half it cannot.
 * Target resolution, the decision to ask, and shortfall accounting live here, in
 * the one process that holds every project's registration and every project's
 * live Worker at the same instant.
 *
 * **The queue bounds the target, and the target bounds nothing else.** A project
 * asks for `min(target - live, depth)` Workers: live Workers consume capacity,
 * while the queue depth counts work still available for a new Worker. A loop
 * that asked for the remaining capacity regardless of depth would birth Workers
 * for work that is not there.
 *
 * **A depth is never invented.** `0` means the queue drained; an absent depth
 * means nobody counted it, and the two are told apart in the sentence a reader
 * gets, because only the first of them is a project that has finished. The
 * distinction is `queue-discovery`'s and this module preserves it rather than
 * folding both into "nothing to do".
 *
 * **A refusal ends the whole tick and starts a backoff.** The host refuses on a
 * host-wide ceiling, so the next request would be asked only to be refused —
 * asking anyway is exactly how a full machine becomes a busy loop. The refusal
 * is recorded as an ordinary outcome carrying the host's own words, never as an
 * error, because the host is the party that knows.
 *
 * **A project that cannot keep a Worker alive stops being asked.** A refusal is
 * the host saying no; a Worker that is born and dies seconds later is the host
 * saying yes to something that cannot run. The second shape has no natural end:
 * the target is unmet, so the loop asks again, and a boot that fails
 * deterministically — a probe that refuses, a precondition that will not become
 * true by waiting — fails identically on the first attempt and the hundredth.
 * Measured before this existed: 108 births and 108 deaths in one hour for one
 * project, average lifetime 13 seconds, each birth spending GitHub quota that is
 * per token and therefore shared with every other project on the machine. The
 * breaker is per project because the fault is: a looping project must not hold
 * back a healthy neighbour, and a host-wide backoff would make it do exactly
 * that.
 *
 * **A clean "nothing to do" is not a loss.** The breaker asks whether a Worker
 * can boot HERE, and one that booted, read the queue, found it empty and said so
 * answered that question with a yes. Counting it as a loss inverted the meaning:
 * on 2026-08-19 a drained queue emptied three Workers within seconds of birth,
 * the latch armed, and when the queue was repaired nothing was born to consume
 * it until an operator cleared the latch by hand. The streak therefore folds an
 * OUTCOME CLASS beside the lifetime — see
 * {@link RedskilledWorkerBirthOutcome} — and only a death that reached no
 * terminal outcome counts.
 *
 * **A declared budget stops the taking before it stops the drain.** An operator
 * who states `budget_ms` on the registration gets a harvest deadline: past the
 * declared fraction of that budget the planner admits no NEW claim, while every
 * Worker already alive keeps publishing and landing what it carries, because
 * work finished and never landed counts as zero (`harvest-deadline.ts`, #4170).
 * No declared budget, no deadline — the daemon invents none.
 *
 * **Rule 3 survives.** A selector and an argv are carried and handed back; not
 * one branch here turns on what either of them says. The planner reads a depth,
 * a target, a count of live Workers, a streak of short-lived deaths and a
 * budget the operator stated in milliseconds — five numbers — and nothing else. The outcome class is a closed vocabulary of three
 * words the Worker protocol already speaks, never a repository's reason: this
 * module learns THAT a Worker reached a terminal outcome, never what the work
 * was, and the daemon is owed no more than that.
 *
 * PURE.
