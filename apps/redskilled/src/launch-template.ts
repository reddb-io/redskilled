/**
 * launch-template — how one frozen registration still births differing Workers.
 *
 * ADR 0130 Amendment 4 moves birth onto the registration, and a registration
 * carries **one** argv. But a Worker's runner, its model tier, its effort, its
 * retire file and its slot are all decided per birth today: the runner because a
 * runner can degrade mid-drain and the directive is applied on a tick rather than
 * at launch, the slot-scoped env because two Workers of one project must not
 * share a build directory or a retire file. **One fixed argv per project cannot
 * express a decision made per Worker**, and freezing them at registration time
 * would lose the capability rather than move it.
 *
 * **Decision (Amendment 5): a launch is RESTATED, not frozen.** The registration
 * carries an opaque launch template — an argv and an env — that the project
 * rotates on the renewal its session already sends every half-window, and the
 * daemon expands per birth by substituting the handful of facts it already owns.
 * Every project-meaningful word is authored by the project and carried verbatim;
 * the daemon's whole contribution is textual substitution of its own facts.
 *
 * **Why this shape, and not the two next to it.** *Asking the project per grant*
 * preserves everything, but the daemon holds no connection to a session — every
 * request arrives on its own socket — so it would need a reverse channel it does
 * not have, would reinstate the round trip the demand loop exists to remove, and
 * would make every birth fail while a session is momentarily blocked, when the
 * whole point is that a drain outlives its terminal. *Re-registering to swap*
 * needs no new field, but the daemon refuses a duplicate registration, so a swap
 * is a deregister followed by a register and the window between them is a state
 * where the host holds no record of a project that is still draining. Rotating on
 * the renewal costs no new op, no round trip and no window: the renewal is a
 * message the live session already sends, and a registration with nothing to
 * restate is exactly the renewal that exists today.
 *
 * **Rule 3 survives intact.** The daemon does not learn what a runner, a model or
 * an effort is. It knows four facts about a birth — the Worker's id, its slot, its
 * workspace and its log path — and the only question it asks a template word is
 * whether that word mentions one of them. A word that mentions none is copied.
 *
 * **An unknown fact is refused, never passed through.** A Worker born with a
 * literal `{{tier}}` in its argv is a Worker nobody meant to start, and the shape
 * of that mistake is a typo in a client — so it fails closed at expansion, with
 * the name it did not recognise and the ones it knows.
 *
 * PURE: every input is passed in, the facts included.
 */

/**
 * The facts the daemon may substitute into a launch — and the whole of them.
 *
 * Each one is something the daemon owns at the instant of birth and the project
 * cannot know in advance: the Worker's id is minted per birth, the slot is chosen
 * per placement, and the workspace and log path are the ones the host will
 * actually use. Nothing here is work knowledge, which is why the list can be
 * frozen: a fifth entry would have to be a fact the daemon owns, and there is no
 * runner, model or effort among those.
