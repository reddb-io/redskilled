/**
 * memory-sampler — the floor every placement backend stands on.
 *
 * **Every backend guarantees the same floor**, so backends differ in the
 * *quality* of their teeth and never in whether they have any. A cgroup, a Job
 * Object or an rlimit is an upgrade in precision and latency over this sampler —
 * never a replacement for it, and never a reason for a host without one to run
 * a Worker with no ceiling at all.
 *
 * **One sample per tick covers the whole set.** The sampler is handed every
 * Worker at once and answers for all of them, because the accounting cost is a
 * property of the host's process table rather than of how many Workers happen to
 * be running: a per-Worker read would make the instrument more expensive exactly
 * as the machine got busier, which is when it must stay cheap.
 *
 * **A budgeted termination names the budget, and is never a stall.** A Worker
 * killed for memory and a Worker that hung are different facts with different
 * cures, and conflating them has already cost a debugging session — so the
 * outcome carries the budget's own name (`MemoryMax`/`MemoryHigh`), the declared
 * value, the observed RSS, and the workspace whose branch or PR is handed
 * forward.
 *
 * **RSS and CPU come out of the SAME walk.** Three states hold memory and read
 * alike by RSS alone — a Worker running a long gate, a Worker hung on a wedged
 * command, and a Worker already dead and unreaped — and accumulated CPU time is
 * what separates them. It is read from the `/proc/<pid>/stat` line already open
 * for RSS, so the second measurement costs no second instrument and no per-Worker
 * read: the tick's price stays the host's process table.
 *
 * **The cgroup is asked first, because the daemon created it.** A unit's
 * `memory.current` is the kernel's own charge for every process inside the
 * boundary the placement drew, so it cannot miss a descendant by construction —
 * no ppid chain to walk, nothing to reparent away, and no way for the recorded
 * pid to be the `systemd-run` client rather than the unit's main process. That
 * last case is not hypothetical: it read a 5.38 GiB pair of Workers as `14.6M`,
 * low by a factor of 377, because the pid the daemon holds under `--wait` lives
 * in the DAEMON's cgroup and its subtree is the client, not the Worker (#3080).
 * The walk remains the floor for a Worker genuinely without a unit, and the
 * reading says which instrument answered rather than presenting both as one
 * number.
 *
 * PURE except for {@link sampleWorkerTrees}, the one function that reads the host.
