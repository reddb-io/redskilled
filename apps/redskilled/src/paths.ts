/**
 * paths — where a `redskilled` daemon lives, and what it holds while it does.
 *
 * **ADR 0130 Amendment 3 scopes the daemon to the MACHINE**, never to a
 * repository and no longer to a session. Two paths carry that between them, and
 * they are not the same kind of thing:
 *
 * - The **runtime dir** is where the daemon *lives* — socket, spawn lock and
 *   session lease. It stays derived from `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, which on Linux is
 *   per **user**, not per login: every terminal and every login of one operator
 *   resolves to the same `/run/user/<uid>`, so this derivation already yields one
 *   daemon for all of that user's sessions. It is a *location*, not the scope.
 * - The **machine claim** is the scope itself — one shared, world-readable record
 *   that every OS user of the machine can see, so the case the runtime dir cannot
 *   reach (two different users, two `0700` directories) ends in one daemon or in
 *   a stated refusal. See `machine-scope.ts` for why refusal is the answer.
 *
 * The host identity stays a *label* on the records rather than part of the key:
 * the key is a path on this machine, and a digest of the hostname adds nothing to
 * a path that is already local. Keying on the repository, then as now, would
 * reinstate exactly the per-project budget the daemon exists to replace.
 *
 * Pure: every input is passed in, so the whole surface is testable without
 * touching the host's real runtime directory.
