/**
 * posix-limits — the POSIX launch boundary and the macOS limits it can carry.
 *
 * **macOS has no resource-group equivalent, and this backend does not pretend
 * otherwise.** Linux gets a cgroup through a transient unit and Windows gets a
 * Job Object; both carry a memory ceiling the kernel enforces. macOS offers
 * POSIX rlimits and priority, and the rlimit that looks like a memory ceiling —
 * `RLIMIT_AS` — bounds ADDRESS SPACE rather than resident memory. A runtime that
 * reserves address space it never faults in would die under a limit it never
 * used, so setting one would trade a real ceiling for a lie about a fake one.
 * The daemon's RSS sampling floor stays the memory ceiling that actually holds
 * here (ADR 0130 rule 4), and every sentence this module produces says so.
 *
 * **What it genuinely adds is priority.** A Worker that runs at a positive nice
 * yields to the operator's interactive work, which is the difference between a
 * busy machine and an unusable one — a real tooth, just not the memory one.
 *
 * **An rlimit is set only where it behaves predictably.** `ulimit -u` and
 * `ulimit -t` are carried when a client declares them and dropped, by name, when
 * the declared value cannot become one — never silently rounded into something
 * nobody asked for. `ulimit -c 0` is unconditional: the same shell argv is also
 * used by unisolated Linux Workers, so neither POSIX launch leaves a core dump
 * behind.
 *
 * PURE, entirely: the host is read in `worker-placement`'s probe and nowhere here,
 * which is what lets every case be proven on a machine that is not a Mac.
