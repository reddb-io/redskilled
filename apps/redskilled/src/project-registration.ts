/**
 * project-registration — what a project contributes, now that it contributes no
 * process.
 *
 * ADR 0130 Amendment 4: **there are exactly two players.** The project's MCP,
 * alive in a user's session, which REGISTERS; and the daemon, alive on the
 * machine, which will own the demand loop. A registration is the whole of the
 * project's side of that seam: a record the daemon stores and reports back.
 *
 * **A registration carries its work, launch, placement and lifetime, and the
 * daemon interprets none of the project-authored parts.**
 * The repository identity — already carried today as the opaque project label. An
 * opaque **selector**, the query that names this project's work. An opaque
 * **argv**, what to run when a Worker is born for it. An opaque **workspace
 * path**, where to run it. A target width. And a renewal deadline, because a
 * registration that died with its MCP would defeat the purpose and one that never
 * expired would make a closed laptop poll forever.
 *
 * The workspace is stated for the same reason the argv is: the daemon owns the
 * demand loop (Amendment 4), so it births the Worker itself, and a host that had
 * to *derive* a working directory would have to know what a checkout looks like
 * — the one thing rule 3 forbids. A path it needs is a path it was given.
 *
 * **Rule 3 is the constraint that shapes this.** The daemon must not learn what
 * an Issue, a label, a Spec, a gate or a Landing *is*. A selector is a string it
 * carries and hands back, never a sentence it reads — exactly as it already
 * carries a Worker's last logged line without parsing it. Amendment 1 moved the
 * frontier by a repository identity and a token; ADR 0133 adds a typed REST
 * equivalent beside the query so the transport can revalidate it without making
 * the daemon parse project semantics.
 *
 * **Shape is checked; meaning never is.** The daemon asks whether it holds a
 * string and whether that string is empty, and that is the last thing it ever
 * asks about a selector's content. An empty selector is refused because a record
 * that names no work is a client bug the daemon can see without reading anything
 * — not because the daemon formed an opinion about what the query says.
 *
 * **The launch is restated, never frozen (Amendment 5).** A Worker's runner, its
 * model tier, its effort and its slot-scoped env are decided per birth, and one
 * fixed argv cannot express a decision made per Worker. So the argv and the env
 * are the one part of a registration a renewal MAY restate: the session rotates
 * them on the message it already sends every half-window, and the daemon expands
 * the daemon's own facts into them at birth (`launch-template.ts`). Everything
 * else a renewal carries over untouched, because a renewal is still a session
 * saying "I am still here" and not a second chance to restate what work it wants.
 *
 * PURE: every input is passed in, the clock included.
