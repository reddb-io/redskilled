/**
 * provision — the route from a machine with no prior state to a reachable daemon.
 *
 * ADR 0130 rule 7 makes start an auto-spawn, which answers *when* a daemon
 * appears and says nothing about what has to exist first. Three things do: the
 * host-scoped home, a published bundle to run, and a socket that answers. This
 * module owns the first, reports on all three, and offers the optional
 * supervising unit rule 7 mentions.
 *
 * **The home is this app's, not `/red-setup`'s.** ADR 0067 gives setup sole
 * authority over a repository's `.red/`; `~/.red/redskilled/` is operator-scoped
 * and outside every checkout, so it was never covered by that authority — and it
 * cannot be, because a home only an interactive installer could create would
 * leave auto-spawn on a fresh machine failing closed with no way back. ADR 0130
 * Amendment 2 records the split: `provisionRedskilledHome` is the ONE creator,
 * and setup is its most important caller.
 *
 * The audit is PURE. Facts about the host are collected by
 * {@link readRedskilledProvisionFacts} and handed in, so `/red-doctor` renders
 * the same verdicts this CLI does without either one growing a private probe.
