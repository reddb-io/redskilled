/**
 * queue-discovery — every registered project's conditionally revalidated depth.
 *
 * ADR 0130 Amendment 3 keeps one host-scoped poller over every registration.
 * ADR 0133 changes its production transport: one conditional REST list per
 * project, whose unchanged 304 costs no API budget, replaces a charged aliased
 * GraphQL query. N round trips are the deliberate latency trade.
 *
 * **A 304 is a depth, not zero.** The ETag store retains the body with its
 * validator, so unchanged is indistinguishable from a fresh identical count.
 * Quota refusal and transport failure still carry null and their own outcome.
 *
 * **Two cadences, not one.** Activity and queue keep their own intervals. Forcing
 * the slow half onto the fast half's rhythm would spend more quota than the
 * batching saves, which is the opposite of the point — so the interval lives with
 * the caller and nothing here assumes the two ever tick together.
 *
 * **A selector is carried, never read.** The project also supplies the equivalent
 * repository-list parameters because it understands selector facets. The daemon
 * carries both shapes to the transport and derives neither, so it still does not
 * know what an Issue, a label, a Spec, a gate or a Landing *is* (rule 3).
 *
 * **Never a zero standing in for an absence.** A selector the token cannot resolve
 * and a spent quota each carry a `null` depth and their own outcome, because "this
 * project cannot be reached", "the quota is spent" and "this queue has drained"
 * are three different facts and only the last of them is a zero — and the last one
 * is the one that deregisters a project, so mistaking the other two for it would
 * retire a project that still has work.
 *
 * PURE, apart from `fetchQueueDiscovery`, whose transport is injected.

/**
 * How long until the next queue poll, given what the last one saw. PURE.
 *
 * **The balance arrives free with every poll and used to be thrown away.** This
 * document has carried a `rate_limit` since it existed and nothing read it,
 * while the poll ran on a constant — so the daemon asked at exactly the same
 * rate whether the token was full or one request from empty.
 *
 * A fixed cadence must choose once between two opposite situations: slow at the
 * edge, where the number moves fastest and matters most, or wasteful in the
 * middle, where nothing is going to run out. This chooses per poll.
 *
 * **It may only ever slow DOWN.** Polling faster on a low balance would spend
 * more of exactly the budget it just noticed running out.
 *
 * **Exhaustion waits for the reset**, because until then no answer can change:
 * asking again spends a request to be told the same thing. The wait is clamped
 * at both ends so a missing, malformed or absurd reset instant can neither spin
 * nor sleep the poller out of existence.

 * poll can refresh it and removes the recovery proof for an accidental lapse.
 *
 * That is what #3133 actually was. The adaptive cadence introduced in #3121
 * landed at 300_000ms, exactly `REDSKILLED_REGISTRATION_TTL_MS`, so one slow
 * cycle retired a healthy project with a full queue and a Worker still landing.
 * A third of the TTL leaves room for two missed polls before evidence goes stale.
 *
 * Kept as a literal with the arithmetic shown rather than importing the TTL:
 * this module is PURE and imports nothing, and a cross-import for one number
 * would trade that for a constant that must not drift anyway — which is what
 * the guard below is for.
