/**
 * remote-counters — what the tracker holds, counter by counter, each with its age.
 *
 * ADR 0141 decision 2 makes every remote counter daemon-owned: open pull
 * requests, open Issues, and the ready and human queue counts come from one
 * poll, on one cycle, in one payload. Decision 3 makes the read free of the
 * network — a request never fetches, so what a surface renders is whatever the
 * last poll stored, and the only honest way to serve that is to state how old it
 * is.
 *
 * **The age is per COUNTER, not per poll.** `repository_activity` dates the poll,
 * which is the right unit for "when did this daemon last talk to GitHub". It is
 * the wrong unit for a line that renders four numbers side by side: a counter
 * nobody asked for and a counter fetched a second ago sit in the same document,
 * and one poll-wide `age_ms` describes neither. Here every counter carries the
 * instant that produced IT.
 *
 * **Absent is not stale, and neither is zero.** Three facts wear the same shape
 * on a naive render — "this queue has drained", "the quota was spent before we
 * asked", "no label was ever named for this counter" — and only the first is a
 * number. A counter with no value carries `null`, its own reason, and `stale:
 * false`, because nothing old is being shown when nothing was ever shown.
 *
 * **Derived once, here, for every surface.** The alternative is each consumer
 * subtracting instants itself, which is how three surfaces come to print three
 * ages for one poll — the same reason the staleness block exists at all.
 *
 * PURE.
