/**
 * repository-activity — every registered project's conditionally revalidated counts.
 *
 * ADR 0130 Amendment 1: **the daemon holds one token and the repository identity
 * of each registered project, and fetches every project's activity counts with
 * one host-scoped poller.** Rendering the statusline needs open pull
 * requests, open Issues and recently closed work, and those come from the issue
 * tracker rather than from any process the daemon owns.
 *
 * **The frontier moves by exactly two items.** The daemon learns a repository
 * identity per project and a token; it still does not know what an Issue, a pull
 * request, a label, a gate or a Landing *is*. A count is an integer it stores and
 * returns without interpreting, exactly as it carries a Worker's last logged line
 * without parsing it.
 *
 * **ADR 0141 adds two label NAMES, and no meaning.** The ready and human queue
 * counters moved here from the statusline's own `gh` cache, so a project hands
 * over the two strings whose open Issues it wants counted apart. The daemon
 * compares those strings to the label names the representation already carries
 * and stores two more integers; what makes a label a queue stays with the
 * project, exactly as a selector it carries but never parses does.
 *
 * **N round trips, usually zero budget.** Each project has three stable REST
 * list representations. Their ETags make an unchanged collection answer 304,
 * which costs no API budget; GraphQL charged the full aggregate on every poll.
 * The latency trade is deliberate on a poller, where budget binds and wall-clock
 * slack exists. The aliased GraphQL path remains only for injected migration
 * adapters that do not expose conditional lists.
 *
 * **A 304 is the held answer, never an empty one.** The typed client keeps each
 * validator with the body it validates. Rate-limit and network failures remain
 * failures with null counts; only an actual unchanged response reuses data.
 *
 * **The condition is checked in code, not assumed in prose.** Every repository on
 * the host must be reachable with the same token; a project that declares its own
 * credential invalidates the arrangement rather than bending it, so registering
 * one throws instead of quietly polling with the wrong identity.
 *
 * **Never a zero standing in for an absence.** An unreachable repository and a
 * rate-limited fetch each carry `null` counts and their own outcome, because "the
 * token cannot see this repository", "the quota is spent" and "there is genuinely
 * nothing open" are three different facts about a project and only the last of
 * them is a zero.
 *
 * **The surface is not this module's to pick.** Which GitHub API answers a call
 * is owned by `@reddb-io/github`, which the castle imports too (ADR 0132
 * decision 4): one table, because two implementations of one routing rule drift.
 * Stable-poll volatility selects conditional REST for production. The legacy
 * aliased-query constants below stay explicit for migration adapters; they are
 * not a second production surface decision.
 *
 * **Dating the answer is not this module's job.** What the stored document MEANS
 * to a reader — how old it is, whether it may be shown as current, how each
 * counter is presented — lives in `./activity-report.js` and
 * `./remote-counters.js`. Here is the spend: the token condition, the
 * conditional lists, and what a 304, a spent quota and an unreachable repository
 * each amount to.
 *
 * PURE, apart from `fetchRepositoryActivity`, whose transport is injected.
