/**
 * self-replace — how a daemon on a superseded bundle becomes one on the current.
 *
 * Nothing in the daemon used to resolve the published version or replace itself,
 * so publishing a release left the singleton serving the old code indefinitely.
 * That is not a hypothetical cost: a long-running supervisor on a superseded
 * bundle killed 21 Workers in 20 minutes, every one halting at boot on version
 * skew, and the only cure was a hand-written pinned dispatch repeated three times
 * (#2808 fixed the same defect one layer up, for the launch). A host-scoped
 * singleton reproduces that failure across every project on the machine at once.
 *
 * Three rules decide this module.
 *
 * **A replacement is a restart, not an evacuation.** Workers are init-system
 * units (ADR 0130 rule 5), so they outlive the daemon that asked for them and the
 * successor re-attaches by unit name through the event lane. Nothing is stopped,
 * drained or re-queued.
 *
 * **The version a daemon reports is the version it runs, always.** The published
 * answer is carried as its own observation next to the running one, never folded
 * into it — substituting the resolved version for the running one is exactly how
 * a stale process reports a healthy zero skew while every Worker boot-halts
 * (#2809). This module therefore *decides*; it never renames what is running.
 *
 * **A local build replaces itself with nothing.** A source checkout is not a
 * point on the published lane, so comparing it to a release is meaningless and
 * acting on the comparison would take a developer's own daemon away mid-session.
 *
 * **A major boundary is held, and the hold is SAID.** A breaking change must not
 * arrive on a machine because a background timer noticed it, so the resolver only
 * ever adopts inside the running major — but a silent hold is indistinguishable
 * from being current, and an operator who updated the plugin to a new major and
 * saw nothing change had no surface that would tell them why (#2926). The daemon
 * therefore reports the newest published version *whatever its major*, states
 * that not adopting it is deliberate, and names the step that crosses it. A
 * refusal that is stated is a decision; a refusal that is silent is a bug.
 *
 * PURE apart from the injected spawn, exit and existence lookups.
