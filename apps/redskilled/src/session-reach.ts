/**
 * session-reach — read the host, write the project (ADR 0130 rule 9).
 *
 * **Reach is asymmetric, and the asymmetry is the point.** Seeing the machine is
 * a requirement of the problem the daemon exists to solve: an operator diagnosing
 * contention must be able to read every project's Workers from whichever session
 * they happen to be in, and two readers of the same instant must not be able to
 * report different answers. Commanding the machine never was a requirement — and
 * these sessions are largely driven by autonomous agents that do not understand a
 * repository they were not started in, so a blast radius wider than the checkout
 * is a defect waiting for a bad afternoon.
 *
 * So every op lands in exactly one of three reaches. A **host-read** is permitted
 * from anywhere. A **project-write** — dispatch, stop, recycle, steer — is
 * permitted only into the session's own project. **Daemon-life** is the daemon's
 * own process rather than any project's Workers, and it is named here rather than
 * folded into either so that "which ops are project-scoped" stays a closed list.
 *
 * **A refusal never says what it is refusing about.** An unknown target is
 * refused with the same shape as a cross-project one, because a session that
 * could tell "no such Worker" from "not your Worker" would learn another
 * project's Worker set by guessing at it.
 *
 * This is a blast-radius guard between honest clients on one user's own session
 * socket, not an authentication boundary: the daemon believes the project a
 * session states about itself, exactly as it believes every other opaque string
 * a client hands it (ADR 0130 rule 3).
 *
 * PURE: every input is passed in.
