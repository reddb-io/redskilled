/**
 * stable-bundle — the ExecStart target nothing on the host prunes.
 *
 * The #3554 fix made every unit writer emit an ABSOLUTE command, which closed
 * the 203/EXEC hole but left the target's durability to whoever owns the
 * directory it lives in: the npx cache is GC'd, a mise toolchain directory
 * vanishes on `mise prune`, and a repo checkout moves. An absolute path into a
 * pruned cache is the same dead unit wearing a longer name — systemd starts
 * nothing, the boot self-heal never runs because there is no boot, and the
 * host is back to hand surgery.
 *
 * The closure is a copy the daemon owns: `~/.red/redskilled/bundles/`, inside
 * the host-scoped home that outlives every cache on the machine. Every writer
 * that is about to put a `node <bundle>` pair into an `ExecStart` first
 * stabilizes the bundle into that directory and points the unit at the copy.
 * Node itself stays the irreducible dependency — a host that deletes its node
 * has nothing any path can save.
 *
 * **Version attribution must be certain before a copy is named.** A stable file
 * claims its version in its filename, and a resolver later probes it BY that
 * name — a copy filed under a version it is not would serve wrong code with a
 * straight face. So stabilization happens only when the attribution is
 * authoritative: a replacement entry resolved FOR a version, a running daemon
 * copying its own entry under its own reported version, or a source file whose
 * basename already carries its version. Local builds are never stabilized —
 * `0.0.0-dev` is one name for many different bytes.
 *
 * **The home is never created here** (ADR 0130 Amendment 2: the provisioner and
 * the canonical log writer are the creators). A host without the home keeps
 * the entry it resolved — stabilization is an upgrade to durability, not a
 * precondition, and it must never break the upgrade it decorates: every
 * filesystem failure returns the original entry untouched.
