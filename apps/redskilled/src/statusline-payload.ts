/**
 * statusline-payload — one answer to "what is this machine doing".
 *
 * **Every fact here originates from the daemon.** It is the only process that
 * holds the Worker set across projects, so a consumer that kept a private source
 * — a pid file, its own `/proc` read, a per-repository profile — would be a
 * second authority on a question that has one answer, and two surfaces would
 * eventually report different states of the same instant.
 *
 * **Staleness travels inside the payload.** The daemon measures on its own tick,
 * so a read can always land between ticks; a consumer that had to date the answer
 * itself would need the sample interval, the daemon's clock and the read's own
 * latency, and would get it subtly wrong in a different way per surface. Here the
 * age is a field, and rendering it is the whole of a consumer's job.
 *
 * **A total shape, and never a zero standing in for an absence.** An unmeasured
 * Worker carries `null` vitals and is named in `unmeasured_workers`; it never
 * reads as an idle one, because "nothing measured it" and "it is using nothing"
 * are opposite facts about a busy machine.
 *
 * PURE: the host state, the ceiling, the reading and both instants are inputs.
