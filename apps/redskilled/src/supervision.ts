/**
 * supervision — the optional user unit that revives a daemon nobody asked for.
 *
 * ADR 0130 rule 7 chose auto-spawn as the floor **plus** an optional user unit
 * with `Restart=always`. Auto-spawn shipped alone, which left the one
 * component whose absence stops every project on the machine revived only when
 * some client next happens to want work. This module is the other half.
 *
 * **The unit becomes the birth authority, never a second spawn path.** Its `ExecStart` is
 * the same resolved published bundle a client would spawn, given the same session
 * paths on the same flags, so a host with the unit and a host without it run
 * identical code against an identical contract — the difference is who starts
 * it and notices the death. That is why the unit is *rendered from* the entry resolver
 * rather than hand-written: a unit carrying its own idea of the argv would drift
 * from the client's the first time a flag moved.
 *
 * **Every daemon exit is supervised.** `Restart=always` also revives a daemon
 * whose internal shutdown path exits zero. An explicit `systemctl stop` still
 * stays stopped because systemd does not apply the restart policy to an
 * operator-requested stop. A self-replacement keeps its distinct non-zero exit
 * code for observability — see {@link REDSKILLED_REPLACE_EXIT_CODE}.
 *
 * PURE apart from the injected file and `systemctl` IO, so the unit text and the
 * install sequence are both provable on a host with no systemd at all.
