/**
 * worker-display — what a surface SHOWS about one Worker, as its project said it.
 *
 * **The project publishes; the daemon stores and lays out.** Every field here
 * travels on the heartbeat the Worker's own project already sends, exactly as its
 * last logged line does, and the daemon never reads one for meaning: no branch in
 * this process asks what a phase is, whether an origin is `afk` or `go`, or what
 * an issue number refers to. That is what keeps ADR 0130 rule 3 intact while the
 * dashboard reaches statusline parity — the frozen contract widens by one opaque
 * record, not by castle semantics.
 *
 * **The progress bar arrives as two integers, never as a vocabulary.** A daemon
 * that drew a pipeline bar would have to know the pipeline, and the phase order is
 * a per-project fact that changes on a bundle version the daemon does not track.
 * `phase_index` and `phase_total` are the whole of it: the renderer draws
 * `index` completed cells, one cursor and the remainder ahead, and stays ignorant
 * of what any of them are called.
 *
 * **Absent is `null`, never a zero.** A Worker whose project publishes no display
 * record and a Worker genuinely holding zero tokens are opposite facts, and a
 * surface that could not tell them apart would render an unmeasured row as an
 * idle one — the same failure `RedskilledStatuslineVitals` refuses for RSS.
 *
 * **`elapsed` is absent on purpose, and `started_at` is why.** Two surfaces that
 * each published their own elapsed figure would disagree about now the moment one
 * of them sampled a beat later; a start instant is a fact that cannot drift, and
 * the render subtracts it from the payload's own `generated_at`. One clock, read
 * once, in the process that is already dating the answer.
 *
 * PURE.
