/**
 * worker-launch — birth: a spec in, a live Worker and its warnings out.
 *
 * The impure half of placement. It plans (pure, in `worker-placement`), spawns
 * once, and reports what it actually did — including when what it did was worse
 * than what was asked for.
 *
 * **The spec is data, not a description of a repository.** The daemon receives a
 * command, a placement target, a budget, a project label and a workspace path,
 * and it reads none of them for meaning: no marker file is looked for, no parent
 * directory is walked, no layout is assumed. A path it needs is a path it was
 * given (ADR 0130 rule 3), which is what lets one daemon serve checkouts pinned
 * to different bundle versions.
 *
 * **A birth carries the verdict that allowed it.** The host-wide admission
 * verdict is a required launch input rather than a check the caller is trusted
 * to have run first, so "no code path spawns a Worker without an admission
 * verdict" is a property of this function instead of a convention every future
 * call site has to remember.
