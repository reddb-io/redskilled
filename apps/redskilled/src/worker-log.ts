 *
 * **The Worker publishes; the daemon stores.** The line travels on the Worker's
 * heartbeat and the daemon normally never reads it for meaning — no level is
 * parsed, no progress is inferred. That is what keeps the global
 * verbose view to ONE read: the line is already in the payload, so a statusline
 * never opens a log, and the daemon never learns what a repository's log layout
 * is (ADR 0130 rule 3).
 *
 * The rejected alternative looks easier and is worse: a statusline that read each
 * Worker's log file directly would cost a disk read per Worker per render, cross a
 * project boundary on every tick, and reintroduce exactly the private source the
 * single-anchor rule forbids — a second authority on a question the payload
 * already answers.
 *
 * **Two bounded exceptions: restart and death before first heartbeat.** A daemon
 * that has just come back may recover one display line for a Worker it adopted.
 * A Worker that exits before publishing anything may have its tail read once so
 * an explicit `session-error:` boot refusal reaches the death surface. Both reads
 * use the path GIVEN at spawn, never one the daemon derives. A Worker whose client
 * gave no log path stays honestly unexplained; guessing a filename inside its
 * workspace would be the derived layout this whole design refuses.
