/**
 * worker-placement — where a Worker's resources are charged, decided at launch.
 *
 * **A transient service unit, never a scope.** A scope runs inside the caller's
 * own unit and cannot outlive it, so every Worker would die with the daemon that
 * asked for it — and ADR 0130 rule 5 needs the opposite: units owned by the init
 * system, so the daemon can restart and re-attach by unit name instead of taking
 * every project's work down on an upgrade.
 *
 * **Placement is decided at launch, not adjusted afterwards**, because moving a
 * running process between resource groups does not move its existing memory
 * charge. A Worker born in the caller's group stays charged there for its whole
 * life no matter what is done to it later.
 *
 * The shape follows `fleet-scope` (#2697): this module is PURE planning over
 * injected probes, and the one impure read of the host lives in
 * {@link detectWorkerPlacementProbes}. That is what lets the Linux-with-session
 * and Linux-without-session cases be proven without spawning anything.
