/**
 * worker-workspace — where a Worker's bytes live, and who deletes them.
 *
 * ADR 0149 §1: **a Worker's workspace is created by the daemon under the OS
 * temporary directory**, `os.tmpdir()/red-skills-<uid>/workers/<id>/`, forked
 * from the daemon-owned Project workspace. Nothing a Worker writes lands in the
 * human's checkout, and the daemon deletes the whole directory when the Worker
 * dies.
 *
 * The move is not tidiness. Workers materialised under the client checkout's
 * `.red/tmp/workers/` beside human worktrees, and on one developer machine that
 * lane reached 3.1 GB across 1593 directories. The janitor that swept it needed
 * three guards against deleting the wrong thing (#2679, #3650) — all three
 * because it shared a directory with live work it did not own. **A cleaner that
 * owns everything it can see needs no guards at all**, which is why the location
 * is the fix rather than a fourth guard.
 *
 * Two properties the layout is chosen for:
 *
 *   - **The uid segment is the boundary, and `0700` is the enforcement.** The OS
 *     temporary directory is shared by every user of the machine, so a workspace
 *     holding a checkout of somebody's private repository cannot be world-
 *     readable, and two operators on one host cannot land in one directory.
 *   - **The Worker id is the whole name.** It is fixed-width base62 of the birth
 *     instant (ADR 0149 §3), so a listing sorts as a timeline and pruning births
 *     older than a cutoff is a prefix scan rather than a stat of every entry.
 *
 * The daemon may find the OS has reclaimed the directory under it — that is the
 * accepted cost of the location, and precisely why the evidence a human reads
 * after a reboot lives somewhere else (ADR 0149 §2).
