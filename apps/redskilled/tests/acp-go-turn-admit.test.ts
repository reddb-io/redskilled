// go_dispatch used to admit a Worker and stop: the native Worker enters its
// Ticket loop only through a prompted handoff, so every dispatched Worker sat
// idle forever with its Ticket unclaimed (observed live 2026-08-25, twice —
// worker born, session/new answered, no prompt ever sent, no child spawned).
// The admit now RUNS the unattended demand turn and answers at admission, so
// the dispatching client may hang up the moment it has its Worker id.
