// The repository poll spends budget for whoever is watching (ADR 0141, #3564).
//
// The counters used to come from a local `gh` cache under a fifteen-minute TTL,
// so an operator watching the line could not react to the repository. Moving the
// fetch into the daemon fixes the freshness and creates the opposite hazard: a
// host nobody is attached to would poll GitHub forever at the attended rate.
//
// Presence is the input, and it is the daemon's existing one — a session that is
// alive renews the registration it holds, which `registrationRenewalStatus`
// already calls `renewing`. Everything here drives that with a fake clock.
