 * The App was a payer nobody measured.

 * `balance.toon` and `balance-history.toonl` were written by ONE process — the
 * host daemon — asking on ONE credential, the operator's token. The App's bucket
 * was spent entirely by other processes, so an installation could carry
 * thousands of reads an hour and appear on no surface: the snapshot measured the
 * person, every history row was stamped `pat`, and
 * `balance-app-<installation>.toon` was named in the contract and written by
 * nobody. Redwall plotted a single sawtooth and called it the machine.
