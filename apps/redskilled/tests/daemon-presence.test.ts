// "I could not reach it" is not "it is not there" (#3092).
//
// Every client refused a daemon that was alive, listening and actively working,
// and reported it as one that never started — then advised provisioning it. The
// mechanism was a correctly-functioning singleton: the client's own redundant
// spawn was refused because a live pid held the lease, and that `exit 1` was
// rendered as "the daemon did not start". The healthy path and the broken path
// printed the same sentence.
//
// These checks pin the four facts that keep them apart:
//
//   1. the classifier separates answering / held-unresponsive / absent, and only
//      the last one is an absence to provision;
//   2. a client facing a socket a live pid holds does NOT spawn a rival, and its
//      refusal names that pid and socket rather than "did not start";
//   3. a live daemon stays reachable from every surface no matter how old its
//      lease record is — no freshness check may reject a working host;
//   4. the operator advice a project prints never says "provision" when the reach
//      established that a daemon is running.
