// A dead Worker's record occupied a slot forever, and no verb could release it
// (#3123).
//
// The pid was dead, the systemd unit was gone, and the record was two hours old.
// The daemon still said `host 1w/1p` and refused to birth anything at `target: 1`
// while eight ready issues sat undrained. The sweep it already ran only ever
// asked about RE-ATTACHED Workers — the ones adopted across a restart — so a
// record born here whose launch client died without delivering an exit was never
// asked about at all.
//
// These checks pin the reaping and its cadence: the record goes on the liveness
// sweep, WITHOUT a daemon restart, and the sweep runs before a birth decision
// rather than only when the machine goes idle. The newborn grace is pinned too,
// because the opposite bug — reaping a Worker mid-birth — is the one a wider
// sweep invites.
