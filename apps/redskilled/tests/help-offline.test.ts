/**
 * `redskilled --help` answers on a host where nothing works (issue #2918).
 *
 * The bug was not that usage was wrong — it was that asking for it routed to the
 * default `host-state` command, which asks the daemon. The operator typing
 * `--help` is usually already lost: the daemon will not start, or they are
 * hunting for the subcommand that stops it. So the proof here is not "usage was
 * printed" but "usage was printed AND the client module was never touched",
 * because the first can be true while a daemon is spawned behind it.
