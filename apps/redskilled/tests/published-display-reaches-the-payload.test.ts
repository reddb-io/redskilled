// A display a Worker PUBLISHES is a display the surfaces READ (#3144).
//
// Every link in this chain read correct in isolation and the chain was silent:
// the castle bridge built the record, the client sent it on the beat, the daemon
// stored it — and the render read never named the `display` extra, so the daemon
// withheld it exactly as it is designed to. Four surfaces drew a UUID and an age
// while runner, model, effort, issue, phase and the progress bar sat unasked.
//
// `display-is-asked-for.test.ts` pins the ONE line that broke, at the source. This
// pins the WHOLE chain, over a real socket, so a future break at any other link —
// a daemon that stops storing, a payload that stops carrying, a withholding rule
// that widens — fails here rather than in a screenshot weeks later.
//
// Driven from a fixture rather than from a live Worker on purpose: a host whose
// installed plugin is behind publishes nothing at all, and a regression test that
// only passes on a freshly-updated machine is a test nobody trusts.
