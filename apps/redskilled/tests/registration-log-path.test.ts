// A registration-lane Worker's output reaches a surface, or it reaches none (#3079).
//
// Before this file the AFK lane was the one birth lane that declared nothing
// about where its Worker logs. `log_path` had been one of the four launch facts
// since Amendment 5, but only the direct `worker-start` lane could state it — a
// project that registers hands over a template and is never asked again — so
// every registration-lane Worker arrived at the herdr plugin, the VS Code
// extension and the verbose statusline carrying no path, and each of them
// reported the absence as a Worker with nothing to say.
//
// Two properties, and they are the same property at two ends: the template can
// SAY where the log goes, and the daemon's own birth is what WRITES the fact in.
