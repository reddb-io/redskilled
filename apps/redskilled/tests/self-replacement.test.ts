// A daemon on a superseded bundle replaces itself with the published one, and
// the Workers do not notice.
//
// Nothing in the daemon used to resolve the published version or replace itself,
// so a release left the host-scoped singleton serving old code indefinitely —
// the failure that killed 21 Workers in 20 minutes one layer up (#2808), with a
// wider blast radius here because every project on the machine shares this one
// process. These checks pin the four facts that make the upgrade safe:
//
//   1. the DECISION is honest — a local build, an unresolved answer and an older
//      published version all hold, and only a newer one replaces;
//   2. the successor runs EXACTLY the published version, or the attempt refuses
//      loudly rather than landing on whatever is newest locally;
//   3. the swap is a RESTART, not an evacuation: the live Worker survives it and
//      the new process re-adopts it;
//   4. the daemon never reports a version it is not running — the published
//      answer travels beside the running one, never inside it;
//   5. the check is REACHABLE at all — the daemon is always on (ADR 0150 §4), so
//      there is no idle boundary left to ask at and the boot look and the
//      interval are the WHOLE upgrade path, both of which must fire and be seen
//      to have fired (#2975);
//   6. the daemon SAYS which happened — `checks` beside `hold_reason`, so "the
//      timer never fired" is never again investigated as "it fired and held".
