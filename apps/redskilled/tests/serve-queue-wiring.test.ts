// The demand loop only runs on a daemon that can ask (#2908).
//
// `serve` held the loop and the poller as options nothing on the shipped path
// ever set, so a machine running the real binary registered projects, counted no
// queue, and birthed nothing — while every in-process test of the loop stayed
// green. This pins the wiring itself: what arms the poller, what leaves it
// unarmed, and where it asks.
//
// **No token, no poller — and no invented depth.** A daemon that cannot reach
// the tracker holds registrations it never counts, which reads as `queue-unknown`
// at every tick. That is the honest state, and it is distinguishable from a
// drained queue, which is the distinction the whole amendment turns on.
