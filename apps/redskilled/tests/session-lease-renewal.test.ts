// `renewed_at` must advance while the daemon runs — #3092.
//
// The lease shipped with a `renew()` and ZERO callers, so after five hours of
// continuous, working uptime the record still read `renewed_at == acquired_at`.
// A field nothing advances is worse than no field at all: it invites exactly the
// freshness check that would then be permanently wrong about a healthy host.
//
// The first check is the behaviour; the second is the wiring. Both are here
// because the wiring is what regressed — a mechanism designed on one side and
// called from nowhere reads as present in review and is absent in production,
// the same shape as #3079's heartbeat publisher and #3081's dropped launch env.
