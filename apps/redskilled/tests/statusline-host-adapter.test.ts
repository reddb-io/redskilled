// ONE producer draws the Worker rows, and the recipe is pinned HERE — in the
// package that owns the daemon's string — by reading the shipped documents
// rather than by anyone remembering to look (#2928).
//
// **Which producer, and why not the daemon yet (#3166).** Rule 10 says the
// daemon owns the Worker line, and #2928 wired the recipe to it: the dev bundle
// was asked for the header alone with `--no-workers` and the daemon's own
// `statusline` was echoed under it. That delegation was made before the thing
// delegated to could draw. What the operator actually got was a name and a
// memory figure where the dev bundle had been drawing a bar, a colour, aligned
// `run=`/`org=`/`iss=` columns, `phase·activity`, elapsed, heartbeat, diff and
// token vitals — code already in the tree and already tested. So the recipe is
// reversed to the single-producer form until #3151 rewrites the daemon's `line`
// density to carry that row.
//
// What did NOT change is the count: two renderers on screen is the defect #2928
// named, and the test below still refuses it — from the other side. The recipe
// may not run the daemon half (a second block of rows under the first) and may
// not mute the dev bundle (no rows at all). Restoring the delegation is one edit
// here plus one in `statusline-command-doc.ts`, and #3151 is what earns it.
//
// The second half is the claim rule 10 rests on: what the daemon's own command
// prints is byte-for-byte what the daemon handed it. Not "contains the Worker
// ids", not "looks right" — the same string, compared. That contract is live
// today, for every surface that reads the daemon; only the Claude Code statusLine
// recipe is on the interim detour.
