// One Worker stop took the whole machine's daemon off the air for ninety
// seconds, and every MCP client on the host read that as a dead daemon.
//
// The stop asked `systemctl --user stop <unit>` and WAITED for the job to
// finish. A runner that ignores SIGTERM does not finish it — the unit sits in
// `deactivating (stop-sigterm)` until `TimeoutStopSec` escalates to SIGKILL —
// and because the request was placed with `spawnSync`, the daemon's event loop
// was held for the whole of it. Workers are `--once` and recycle constantly, so
// this fired many times an hour, and each time a `ping` with a ten-second
// deadline came back as "daemon unreachable".
//
// These checks pin the three things the fix owes: a read still answers while a
// stop is in flight, the stop's own answer still means the host confirmed the
// death, and one Worker is still one death however many callers ask at once.
