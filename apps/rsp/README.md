# @reddb-io/rsp

`rsp` is the RedSkills command-output reducer for agent terminal work. It wraps
high-noise commands, emits compact decision-preserving output, and keeps the
original bytes recoverable through `el:<id>` handles.

Benchmark headline: `rsp` reaches **99.2% decision-oracle capture** versus
**RTK 4.9%** and **Headroom 0.6%** on the two-axis benchmark. The checked-in
summary is at [bench/results/rsp-two-axis.md](bench/results/rsp-two-axis.md),
and the benchmark guide is at [bench/README.md](bench/README.md).

## What rsp Does

`rsp` is both an explicit CLI and a hook target:

- `rsp <command> <args...>` accepts any non-interactive command. Unrecognized
  simple argv launches through the fast boundary without loading configuration,
  telemetry, the store, or the resident. After completion, JSON, YAML, XML,
  TOON, or TOONL stdout becomes canonical TOON only after a lossless round-trip
  proof; all other bytes pass through unchanged. XML conversion uses the pinned
  `tq` canonical tree instead of an RSP-owned representation. Large repetitive
  structured rows are
  reduced only after deterministic size and repetition thresholds are crossed;
  the TOON result declares its cap or sort, includes aggregates and next steps,
  and carries one recovery handle whose original bytes were stored first.
- `rsp git status`, `rsp git diff`, `rsp git log`, `rsp git show`,
  `rsp git blame`, `rsp git branch -av`, `rsp git commit`, and `rsp git push`
  render git output as compact TOON when that keeps the decision signal.
- `rsp gh pr|issue|run list|view` keeps GitHub rows, bodies, and failure states
  readable while avoiding repetitive raw payloads.
- `rsp vitest run` and `rsp cargo test` keep exit code, summary, and failing
  rows instead of streaming full green-suite logs.
- `rsp cat <file>` and `rsp cat --head N|--tail N <file>` provide bounded file
  reads. Code files include a symbol outline plus head/tail context; binary
  files pass through unchanged.
- `rsp exec -- "<command>"` runs a shell command, summarizes structured or large
  stdout, and preserves the command's stderr and exit status.
- `rsp wait ...` is the standalone coordination primitive for commands, GitHub
  PRs, workflow runs, and releases. It emits a versioned TOON/JSON result that
  is durable before it wakes anyone, keeps the target verdict separate from the
  delivery receipt, bounds every command and GitHub probe by timeout and
  cancellation, and verifies that no descendant survives.
- `rsp show el:<id>` writes the original bytes for an elided handle.
- `rsp`, `rsp stats`, and `rsp gains` report elision-store and telemetry gains.
- `rsp mcp` exposes the resident-backed compression surface for MCP clients.
- `rsp hook claude-pre-exec`, `rsp hook claude-post-exec`, and
  `rsp hook codex-pre-exec` are the hook interception surfaces used by
  supported agent hosts.

## Provisioning

`rsp` ships as a small Node.js boundary (`dist/rsp.bundle.min.mjs`) and a lazy
modeled-command core (`dist/rsp-core.bundle.min.mjs`) inside the RedSkills
plugin distribution. No global `npm install -g` is required.
Supported agent hosts wire the hook command as:

```sh
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/rsp.bundle.min.mjs" hook claude-pre-exec
```

This resolves the binary from the active plugin root rather than `PATH`. If the
bundled entry point cannot be resolved, the hook passes the original command
through unchanged — never `command not found`.

**Optional PATH shim.** For interactive shell use,
`plugins/dev/skills/engineering/red-setup/scripts/install-runtime-shim.sh`
installs a thin `rsp` shim at `${XDG_BIN_HOME:-$HOME/.local/bin}/rsp`. The
shim prefers the active CLI plugin-root env var, then scans known plugin caches
and the warmed bundle cache under
`${RED_SKILLS_CACHE_DIR:-$HOME/.cache/red-skills/bundles}`. It never runs `npm`
or performs network resolution during session startup.

**Opt-ins.** Hook rewrites and proxy routing are off by default. Enable them
per-repository in `.red/config.yaml`:

- `rsp.enabled: true` — activates hook rewrites for supported command families.
- `rsp.proxy.enabled: true` — additionally routes every eligible command through
  `rsp proxy` for universal coverage (see [Permanent Proxy Model](#permanent-proxy-model)).

Absent `rsp.enabled`, the hook is fully inert and all commands pass through
unchanged.

**Escape hatches.** To skip proxy routing for a single command invocation, set
`RSP_NO_PROXY=1` or `RED_SKILLS_RSP_NO_PROXY=1` in the environment. To disable
proxy routing for the whole repository while keeping explicit wrapper rewrites
active, set `rsp.proxy.enabled: false` in `.red/config.yaml`.

**Failure semantics.** If the bundled entry point cannot be resolved, the hook
passes the original command through raw. If a wrapper or resident path fails,
`rsp` degrades to the raw command preserving stdout, stderr, and exit status.
Token efficiency is opportunistic; loss of `rsp` never causes a broken or
missing command result. See
[Fail-Open Invariant](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md#fail-open-invariant).

## Permanent Proxy Model

The pre-exec hook has two modes after `rsp.enabled: true` is set. Without the
proxy flag it rewrites only the explicit wrapper families listed in the
generated ambient skill. With `rsp.proxy.enabled: true`, the hook rewrites the
whole eligible shell command to:

```sh
rsp proxy -- "<original command>"
```

The universal hook route has deliberate exclusions. It passes through empty or
missing commands, background jobs using a single `&`, recursive `rsp` calls,
known interactive commands such as shells, editors, pagers, `ssh`, and process
monitors, and commands opted out with `RSP_NO_PROXY=1` or
`RED_SKILLS_RSP_NO_PROXY=1`.

`rsp proxy` then makes a contribute-or-pass decision per recognized shell
segment. It contributes only for stdout-tail segments it can wrap without
changing upstream bytes:

- git `status`, `log`, `diff`, `show`, and `blame`
- GitHub `pr|issue|run list|view`
- `vitest`, `vitest run`, and `cargo test`
- simple `cat`, `head`, and `tail` file reads

Pipeline producers are not rewritten, so bytes inside pipes remain untouched.
Shell shapes it cannot model keep the original shell execution path, including
its redirects, short-circuiting, exit status, and termination signal.
Only completed agent-facing stdout crosses the lossless structured-data
boundary. Stderr and exit status remain native, and any failed proof returns the
original stdout byte-for-byte.
GitHub commands using `--json` or `--jq` are a special lossless family: they are
recorded as `lossless-gh-json-jq` passes and keep their native protocol bytes
inside the shell. Their completed stdout may still become canonical TOON at the
final agent boundary.

## Contribution Metrics

`rsp stats` reports decision telemetry from the dedicated decision lane:
`seen`, `contributed`, `passed`, `failed_open`, `contribution_rate`, and the top
pass reasons. A contributed decision means rsp inserted a wrapper. A passed
decision means the hook or proxy intentionally left the command or segment raw.
A failed-open decision means rsp hit an internal failure and ran the original
command instead.

Treat these metrics as the contract for what rsp actually changed. They can
substantiate proxy coverage, opt-outs, lossless GitHub JSON/JQ passes, and
fail-open behavior; they do not claim compression for unrecognized command
families.

The generated ambient instruction that agents read is
[generated/AMBIENT-SKILL.md](generated/AMBIENT-SKILL.md). Regenerate it after
wrapper capability changes with:

```sh
pnpm --filter @reddb-io/rsp gen:ambient-skill
```

## Recovery Model

When `rsp` omits bytes, it prints an `el:<id>` handle. Handles are short,
content-addressed identifiers minted by `RspElisionStore.mint(original, meta)`.
The resident writes handle records into the rsp-owned RedDB KV collection and
chooses one of three storage classes:

- **derivable**: git blob-backed output such as `git diff`, `git log`, `git show`,
  `git blame`, and file reads that can be reconstructed from stored object ids.
- **re-executable**: deterministic repository commands such as `git status` and
  `git branch -av` whose command recipe and content hash are enough to replay or
  detect moved state.
- **ephemeral**: outputs that must keep bytes, stored as gzip-compressed
  content-hash blobs so identical outputs share one physical blob.

Each handle records the command, loss level, creation time, expiry time, raw byte
count, storage class, and stored byte cost. The accounting lane is the handle
index: it totals stored bytes, raw bytes, and per-class records so `rsp stats`
can report both recoverability and physical pressure. The default 64 MiB
physical cap applies to stored recipe/blob bytes, not raw command-output bytes.
Expired or evicted handles retain a tombstone with the original command to rerun.

Recover a handle with:

```sh
rsp show el:<id>
```

Universal output controls use an explicit separator so flags never leak into
the wrapped argv: `rsp --brief -- <command> <args...>`, `rsp --terse -- ...`,
and `rsp --full -- ...`. `--full` keeps the complete structured result and
suppresses automatic reduction.

Defaults are seven days of derivable/re-executable elision retention, six hours
of ephemeral retention, and a 64 MiB physical cap; `.red/config.yaml` can
override `rsp.ttlDays`, `rsp.ephemeralTtlHours`, and `rsp.byteBudget`.

## Resident and Telemetry

`rsp` uses a resident process so wrappers do not repeatedly open the embedded
RedDB store. Clients talk to the resident over a local socket. The resident owns
the single embedded writer, serves mint/get/stats/gains requests, drains
telemetry from a spool into RedDB, writes a statusline summary, and exits after
an idle timeout.

The full lifecycle is documented in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).
That document covers the socket protocol, PID registry, version handover,
idle shutdown watchdog, telemetry spool and drain path, gains report, elision
store, wait registry, and the fail-open invariant.

## Configuration

`rsp` is enabled per repository with `.red/config.yaml`:

```yaml
rsp:
  enabled: true
  proxy:
    enabled: true
```

Useful optional keys:

- `rsp.ttlDays`: elision handle retention days.
- `rsp.ephemeralTtlHours`: ephemeral byte-blob retention hours.
- `rsp.byteBudget`: elision byte budget.
- `rsp.telemetryTtlDays`: telemetry retention days.
- `rsp.telemetryByteBudget`: telemetry byte budget.
- `rsp.telemetryDrainIntervalMs`: resident drain interval.
- `rsp.telemetryDrainTimeoutMs`: per-drain timeout.
- `rsp.idleMs`: resident idle timeout, with a five-second minimum.
- `rsp.heavyGitByteThreshold`: threshold for large git/file/exec output.
- `rsp.overhead.maxOverheadMs`: wall clock rsp may add per invocation.
- `rsp.overhead.maxSelfStateBytes`: bytes rsp may read from its own state per
  invocation.
- `rsp.overhead.netLossFloorBytes`: below this, self-state reads are too small to
  count as a net loss.
- `rsp.overhead.consecutiveBreaches`: breaches before a wrapper family
  self-disables.
- `rsp.overhead.cooldownMs`: how long a self-disabled family stays off.

A wrapper family that breaks its overhead ceiling for
`rsp.overhead.consecutiveBreaches` consecutive invocations self-disables and runs
raw commands until its cooldown lapses. `rsp status` renders the verdict — green
or red — and `rsp doctor` fails while a ceiling is breached.

If `rsp.enabled` is absent or false, wrapper commands pass through or report
that rsp is disabled. If a wrapper or resident path fails, `rsp` degrades to the
raw command whenever it can, preserving stdout, stderr, and exit status.
