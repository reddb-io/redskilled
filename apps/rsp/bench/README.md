# rsp Two-Axis Benchmark

The rsp benchmark measures two separate questions:

1. **Decision-oracle capture**: how close the emitted output is to the
   hand-reviewed compact oracle for each fixture, measured with
   `js-tiktoken:gpt-4o` token counts.
2. **Fidelity-first behavior**: whether the emitted output still preserves the
   command facts an agent needs, such as exit status, failure rows, commit ids,
   PR rows, and recovery handles.

The headline used by the rsp docs is **99.2% decision-oracle capture** for rsp
versus **RTK 4.9%** and **Headroom 0.6%**. The generated result artifacts live
in [bench/results/rsp-two-axis.md](results/rsp-two-axis.md) and
[bench/results/rsp-two-axis.toon](results/rsp-two-axis.toon).

The additive neutral third-party corpus lives in
[bench/results/rsp-two-axis-neutral.md](results/rsp-two-axis-neutral.md) and
[bench/results/rsp-two-axis-neutral.toon](results/rsp-two-axis-neutral.toon).
The side-by-side home/neutral table is
[bench/results/rsp-two-axis-corpus-comparison.md](results/rsp-two-axis-corpus-comparison.md).

## Run It

From the repo root:

```sh
pnpm --filter @reddb-io/rsp bench:two-axis
```

This regenerates the default artifacts:

- `apps/rsp/bench/results/rsp-two-axis.toon`
- `apps/rsp/bench/results/rsp-two-axis.md`

To regenerate the neutral third-party artifacts:

```sh
pnpm --filter @reddb-io/rsp bench:two-axis:neutral
```

This writes:

- `apps/rsp/bench/results/rsp-two-axis-neutral.toon`
- `apps/rsp/bench/results/rsp-two-axis-neutral.md`

To write to explicit paths:

```sh
pnpm --filter @reddb-io/rsp exec node --import tsx src/two-axis-benchmark-cli.ts \
  --out /tmp/rsp-two-axis.toon \
  --summary /tmp/rsp-two-axis.md
```

To run the checked-in regression gate:

```sh
pnpm --filter @reddb-io/rsp bench:two-axis:check
```

The check command reads the current `--out` artifact as the baseline, reruns the
benchmark, rewrites the artifacts, and fails when a current filter regresses by
more than the configured token threshold or loses fidelity. The thresholds live
in `src/two-axis-thresholds.ts`.

## Command-Boundary Latency

Build rsp, then measure the shipped launcher against a direct Node no-op:

```sh
pnpm --filter @reddb-io/rsp build
pnpm --filter @reddb-io/rsp bench:boundary
```

The benchmark samples one cold invocation, 40 warm paired invocations, and 40
in-process structured transformations of a nested reference fixture. Its
reference budgets are at most 200 ms cold, at most 50 ms added p95 passthrough
latency, and at most 100 ms p95 structured transformation. The checked-in
reference is [bench/results/rsp-command-boundary.md](results/rsp-command-boundary.md).

## Corpus

The benchmark discovers fidelity fixtures under `apps/rsp/tests/fixtures`:

- `exec`
- `file-read`
- `gh`
- `git`
- `test-runners`

Each fixture records raw command output and expected decision facts. Most
fixtures have an adjacent `.oracle.toon` file that represents the hand-reviewed
compact oracle. The benchmark requires large-output fixtures for git diff,
git log, vitest green output, and vitest failure output so the result continues
to cover the cases where reduction matters most.

The default invocation is the standing quality arbiter: it runs the pre-existing
quality corpus and the anomaly, mixed-content, and JSON-outlier families in one
report. The generated summary emits oracle-capture and token counts for each
family as well as for the full aggregate.

The RTK and Headroom comparators are recorded baselines:

- `apps/rsp/tests/fixtures/rtk/baselines.json`
- `apps/rsp/tests/fixtures/headroom/baselines.json`

The neutral corpus is discovered under `apps/rsp/tests/fixtures-neutral`.
It is additive and smaller than the home corpus: public run metadata from
vitest-dev/vitest and rust-lang/cargo, public git machine output from
nodejs/node and rust-lang/rust, and Cargo JSON message output following the
published `--message-format=json` contract. Its comparator baselines live next
to it under `fixtures-neutral/rtk` and `fixtures-neutral/headroom`.

The benchmark does not execute RTK or Headroom during normal runs. Headroom
capture is isolated in `apps/rsp/scripts/capture-headroom-baselines.py`.

## Read the Summary

`bench/results/rsp-two-axis.md` starts with the corpus size and admission
threshold. Production mode applies the admission threshold before activating a
filter; passthrough filters count as 0% token delta because rsp returns the
original output for those command shapes.

The main table has one row per filter:

- `Mode`: whether the filter is active in production or passthrough.
- `raw tokens`: token count of recorded command output.
- `rsp tokens`: token count emitted by the production rsp mode.
- `RTK tokens` and `Headroom tokens`: recorded comparator token counts, or
  `not-covered`.
- `oracle tokens`: token count of the hand-reviewed oracle.
- `rsp capture`, `RTK capture`, `Headroom capture`: decision-oracle capture
  percentages. Higher is closer to the oracle.
- `brief shipped delta` and `terse shipped delta`: median and p90 token
  reduction for the shipped rsp modes.
- `fidelity-first score`: percentage of fixtures whose decision assertions
  still pass.

The aggregate line combines all fixtures. It is the fastest way to compare rsp,
RTK, Headroom, raw output, and the oracle ceiling.

The corpus table breaks the same token and oracle-capture numbers down by
quality family. The end-task parity table then checks representative agent
questions against both raw-output answers and rsp-summary answers; every row
must report the same answer.

## Read the TOON Artifact

`bench/results/rsp-two-axis.toon` is the machine-readable report. It includes:

- `method`: tokenizer, raw source, rsp source, oracle source, comparator source,
  and unverified external literature claims.
- `filters`: per-filter rows with raw/brief/terse axes, comparator axes,
  oracle-capture axes, and hypothetical active-mode results for passthrough
  filters.
- `aggregate`: corpus-wide oracle-capture counts and percentages.
- `quality_corpora`: pre-existing, anomaly, mixed-content, and JSON-outlier
  corpus rows with token counts and oracle-capture percentages.
- `parity`: direct fidelity gates for selected parity domains.
- `end_task_parity`: representative same-answer probes comparing raw-output
  answers with rsp-summary answers.
- `anti_suppression_audit`: notes explaining why each filter does not hide the
  decision signal.

Use the Markdown summary for human review and the TOON artifact for regression
checks or downstream analysis.
