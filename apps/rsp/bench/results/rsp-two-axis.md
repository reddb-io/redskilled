rsp two-axis benchmark: 35 fixtures across 16 filters
Corpus: home

Corpus provenance:
- Repo-authored rsp benchmark fixtures under apps/rsp/tests/fixtures.

Production mode uses admission threshold 60%; passthrough filters count as 0% token delta because rsp returns the original command output.

RTK baseline is replayed from checked-in recorded fixtures only; RTK is not executed by this command.
Headroom baseline is replayed from checked-in recorded fixtures only; headroom-ai is only installed by the explicit capture script.
External context-optimization claims are cited literature only and were not locally reproduced.
