# red-pane — repaint one RedSkills surface inside a Zellij pane.
#
# A pane is a repaint, not a wait. `monitor`, `dashboard` and `github-spend` are
# one-shot reads by design, so the loop that keeps a pane current belongs HERE,
# at the host edge, rather than as a `--watch` flag inside the engine: a watch
# flag would add a sleep loop to `apps/plugin-dev/src`, which is the exact shape the
# declared-wait ratchet refuses.
#
# **Every surface is a local read.** No pane may spend GitHub API budget. A pane
# repaints every few seconds forever, so a single gh-backed surface would drain
# the token's REST pool on its own — which is the failure that empties the queue
# and kills every Worker at boot. `github-spend` reports the host's OWN durable
# attribution; it asks GitHub nothing.
#
# Usage: red-pane.sh <surface>
#   fleet  — per-Worker rows: issue, phase, activity, age  (default)
#   host   — host scope: slots, projects, ready counts, deaths
#   spend  — what this host observed itself spending, all pools
