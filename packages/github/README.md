# @reddb-io/github

The one budget-aware GitHub client (ADR 0132 decision 4, as superseded by
Amendment 2).

## Why it exists

`ghReadSurface` already knew which GitHub API every call used, and spent that
knowledge labelling failures. Nothing routed on it, and its default sent
everything that was not `gh api <path>` to GraphQL — so the hot path (`issue
view --json state,labels` and `pr view --json mergeStateStatus,…`, polled per
Worker per iteration) was single-object reads issued against the pool metered by
node points. Measured twice within one hour on one machine: GraphQL `0/5000`
while REST sat at `4891/5000`.

## Volatility first, cardinality second

A stable poll prefers REST because a conditional request can cost no primary
quota while its answer is unchanged. A one-shot read then follows cardinality:
a **single-object** read prefers REST, while a **multi-node** listing or a
**multi-repository** aggregate prefers GraphQL.

Every operation also declares a fallback client method or states why none is
safe. `assertGithubRoutingTable` enforces that pair. An `only` constraint remains
absolute, and operations drawing from the minute-metered Search pool cannot be
fallback targets. A single-object issue read is therefore REST-preferred with a
GraphQL fallback, while an Actions read has no invented second path.

## Stable polls use conditional REST

Volatility is the exception cardinality cannot price. The daemon's repository
activity and queue discovery reads repeat against usually unchanged collections,
so their production transport uses repository issue and pull-request list
endpoints through `createGithubClient().conditionalPaginate()`. GitHub's Search
endpoint did not return a validator in the migration measurement, while these
list endpoints did. The first `200` stores each page with its `ETag`, and the next
request sends `If-None-Match` per page. A `304` reuses the stored page and records
zero spend; it never becomes an empty answer. Rate-limit refusals and network
failures still fail and cannot fall back to the stored value.

The client is built from `@octokit/rest`, retry, throttling, and the pagination
plugin bundled by REST.js. Interactive and not-yet-migrated reads keep their
existing route while migration proceeds one slice at a time under ADR 0133.

## Cold single-object bursts coalesce

The single-object rule and its counter-rule live together in
`createGithubClient().singleObject()`: one issue or pull request prefers REST,
but cold reads of the same kind that arrive in one turn share one aliased
GraphQL query when their count exceeds the live coalescing threshold. The
threshold is the ratio of REST headroom to GraphQL headroom, rounded up, so it
rises when REST is healthier and falls when GraphQL has room to absorb the
nodes. An unknown balance or a spent GraphQL pool diverts nothing.

Conditional reads are deliberately outside that trade. Once the client holds
an ETag and its answer, that read stays on REST even during a burst: turning a
possible zero-cost `304` into a charged GraphQL node would lose the free tier
that made stable polls REST-preferred in the first place. The saving from a cold
aliased query is one request instead of k REST requests; it is still k objects'
worth of GraphQL points.

## Three budgets, not two

| Pool      | Metered by  | Limit    |
| --------- | ----------- | -------- |
| `rest`    | request     | 5000/hr  |
| `graphql` | node points | 5000/hr  |
| `search`  | minute      | 30/min   |

An operation declares its budget separately from its surface, because GraphQL's
`search` connection draws the Search pool rather than the node-point pool. ADR
0130's claim that one aliased query makes cost "flat in the number of projects"
is true of request count and false of points.

## An unclassified operation fails loudly

`routeGithubArgs` raises `UnclassifiedGithubOperationError` naming the key it
derived and the file to add it to. Adding a gh call to this repo means adding a
line to `GITHUB_OPERATIONS`; it does not mean inheriting whichever pool the old
default happened to pick.

## Realizing the route

Deciding that a read belongs on REST changes nothing on its own — `gh issue view
--json state` runs a GraphQL query regardless. `planGithubRestRead` returns the
`gh api repos/{o}/{r}/issues/{n}` argv plus a decoder projecting the REST body
back into the shape `--json` would have printed, so a call site swaps its argv
and keeps its parsing.

That argv planner remains for call sites not yet migrated. The stable daemon poll
path is the first typed-client slice: it calls REST directly through Octokit,
keeps validators with their response bodies, and attributes a changed response
as cost one and an unchanged response as cost zero.

A field with no single-request REST equivalent is **named, not approximated**:
`comments` (REST carries a count, not the list), `author` (gh normalizes a bot to
`app/<name>`, REST reports `<name>[bot]`), `statusCheckRollup` (a second and
third request). Those come back as `{outcome: "unavailable"}` with the blocking
fields, and the caller keeps its GraphQL call.

## Inner agents share the boundary

An AFK implementer's raw `gh` resolves first to a private shim in the Worker's
disposable workspace. The shim classifies the argv through this package, admits
it against the daemon's kept token-wide balance as convenience work, applies the
same bounded quota retry as engine calls, and forwards to the captured real
binary. Unclassified operations fail closed instead of inheriting a guessed
pool. Every issued invocation, including a retry, is appended to the attribution
ledger with the Worker as `actor`; the canonical operation key stays canonical.

This attribution remains local evidence, not a reconstructed balance. REST cost
is one request; because `gh` does not expose GraphQL node cost, the shim records
the minimum observed cost of one while the exact invocation count and Worker
identity remain available for incident attribution.

## The balance is asked, never counted

The design this replaced was a ledger the daemon **accumulates**: every caller
reports its calls, the daemon totals them. That ledger would have been born
blind. The daemon is host-scoped by construction while a GitHub quota is per
**token**, therefore cross-host — an operator running four machines on one token
would have had four daemons each reporting a quarter of the truth.

`GET /rate_limit` answers for the whole token across every machine and costs
nothing: measured, six consecutive calls moved `core` by exactly zero.
`fetchGithubBalance` asks it; `GithubBalance.origin` is the single literal
`"asked"`, so a counting path cannot construct one without declaring an origin
that does not exist. The ratchet that refuses the accumulator itself lives in
`apps/plugin-dev/src/core/asked-balance-guard.ts` and runs in every gate run.

**Free of *primary* quota only.** GitHub's secondary limits on request rate and
concurrency apply to `/rate_limit` like any other endpoint, so the cadence stays
a cadence — `GITHUB_BALANCE_MIN_CADENCE_MS` is the floor, and that ceiling was
deliberately not probed.

## Cadence is a function of the balance

Because asking is free, `githubBalanceCadenceMs` derives the window rather than
fixing it: rare above half, tightening as the balance falls, continuous once
spent — when the only event that still matters is the reset. A fixed cadence has
to choose between being slow at the edge and wasting polls in the middle; an
adaptive one does not choose. **One poller, the daemon's, never a check before
each call** was the original boundary. The independent `rsp` resident introduced
by #3311 is now a second declared execution owner: it asks at this same adaptive
cadence without coupling to `redskilled`. Neither owner asks once per call; that
would double the request count and put a synchronous round trip in every hot
path.

The curve is driven by the TIGHTEST pool, not by an average. The measurement that
produced this module — 2200 GraphQL points spent while `core` sat at `5000/5000`
— is exactly the shape an average would have called healthy.

## A reserved band, so degradation is graduated

`GITHUB_RESERVED_FRACTION` of each pool is held for work that must not fail.
`admitGithubCall` refuses a `convenience` call once the balance enters the band
and admits an `essential` one until the pool has nothing left at all, where
GitHub would refuse it anyway. Criticality is stated by the CALLER, never tabled
here: `issue comment` is a finished Worker's closing comment on one call and an
optional progress note on the next.

So semi-offline stops being a mode discovered through a 403 and becomes a posture
entered at a threshold an operator can see. `buildGithubBalanceReport` is what
they see it on.

## Routing is graduated too

`githubDiversionDecision` gives the same balance a second axis: which declared
surface should answer an eligible read. Below 70% source pressure the preferred
surface decides alone. At 70% and 90%, progressively larger budget shares can
move to the fallback; a spent preferred pool moves every eligible read. Each
entry threshold has a lower exit threshold so small balance changes do not
bounce a route between surfaces and cool both caches.

Pressure alone does not arm the ramp. The observed spend must project exhaustion
before the pool's hourly reset, so a pool with 7% left and twenty seconds to wait
does not burn its healthy peer merely to avoid that wait. An unread source or
destination balance diverts nothing, and a table entry with no fallback remains
on its only surface.

Partial diversion is denominated in destination budget, not call count. A read
projected to cost five paginated REST requests receives one fifth the call share
of a one-request fallback at the same rung. Selection uses a stable hash of the
operation and concrete routing key, making identical decisions replayable rather
than random. Full diversion is the exception to cost weighting: once the source
is spent, its declared fallback is the only available route.

## A cache that carries its own age

`createGithubCache` keeps counts, bodies and states, and every read comes back
with `age_ms` and an outcome. A stale entry is **labelled, never dropped** — that
is the point: there is nothing to fall back to unless something was kept, and a
cache that evicted on expiry would be empty exactly when the band starts refusing
the reads that would refill it.

## Consumers

`apps/plugin-dev` (the read boundary, the migrated single-object reads and the reserved
band in `runtime/gh/band.ts`), `apps/redskilled` (the daemon's conditional REST
pollers), `apps/rsp` (the independent resident-owned proxy reads), and
`packages/worker` (the tracker adapter) all import this package. One policy,
because two implementations of one routing rule drift — and one authoritative
token answer, however many declared owners observe it.

Production stable collection polls accept N sequential round trips: unchanged
collections answer `304`, so the API budget pays only for repositories whose
representation changed. Cold single-object bursts use the separate coalescing
rule above; warm objects never leave conditional REST.
