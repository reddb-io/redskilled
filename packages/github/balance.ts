// balance.ts — the token's remaining budget, ASKED rather than counted.
//
// ADR 0132 Amendment 2. The predecessor design was a ledger the daemon
// **accumulates**: every caller reports its calls, the daemon totals them. That
// ledger would have been born blind. The daemon is host-scoped by construction —
// one per machine, and ADR 0130 deliberately extinguished the cross-host view —
// while GitHub's quota is per **token**, therefore cross-host. An operator
// running four machines on one token would have had four daemons each counting
// its own share and each reporting three quarters of a fiction: *"I have spent
// 2000 of 5000"* while the token already sat at zero.
//
// **The fix is not federation. It is to stop counting and start asking.** `GET
// /rate_limit` returns the true remaining budget for the whole token across every
// machine, and it costs nothing — measured, six consecutive calls moved `core` by
// exactly zero. The daemon does not need to know the operator's other machines
// exist; it sees their effect in the balance.
//
// Three properties follow, and each is enforced here rather than asked for in
// prose:
//
//   **The balance carries its origin in its type.** {@link GithubBalance.origin}
//   is the literal `"asked"`, so a well-meaning local accumulator cannot produce
//   one without saying, in the type, that it did not ask. The companion ratchet
//   (`asked-balance-guard.ts`) refuses the accumulator itself.
//
//   **The cadence is a function of the balance.** Because asking is free, cadence
//   is derived rather than fixed: rare above half, tightening as the balance
//   falls, continuous once spent — when the only event that still matters is the
//   reset. A fixed cadence forces a choice between being slow at the edge and
//   wasting polls in the middle; an adaptive one does not choose. **One poller
//   per declared execution owner, never a check before each call** — that would
//   double the request count and put a synchronous round trip in every hot path,
//   which is ADR 0084's lesson paid twice. The independent rsp resident is such
//   an owner; it does not couple its read path to redskilled.
//
//   **A stated fraction is reserved.** With an authoritative balance in hand the
//   breaker stops being reactive: convenience reads are refused once the balance
//   enters the reserved band, while the claim, a landing and a finishing Worker's
//   closing comment still pass. Semi-offline stops being a mode discovered
//   through a 403 and becomes a posture entered at a threshold an operator sees.
//
// **A caveat, stated rather than assumed:** `GET /rate_limit` is free of
// *primary* quota only. GitHub also enforces secondary limits on request rate and
// concurrency across every endpoint, so the cadence must stay a cadence — seconds,
// never a poll per operation. {@link GITHUB_BALANCE_MIN_CADENCE_MS} is that floor,
// and the ceiling it defends was deliberately not probed.
//
// PURE, apart from `fetchGithubBalance` and `createGithubBalanceTransport`, whose
// transport is injected.
