// decision 4).
//
// **Volatility first, cardinality second.** A stable poll prefers REST because a
// conditional read can be free while its answer is unchanged. A one-shot read
// uses cardinality: one object → REST, more than one → GraphQL. Each operation
// also names the other surface it can use, or why no second method exists.
//
// **There are THREE budgets, not two.** REST is metered by request (5000/hr),
// GraphQL by node points (5000/hr), Search by minute (30/min). ADR 0130's claim
// that one aliased query makes cost "flat in the number of projects" is true of
// request count and false of points, which is why an operation declares the pool
// it draws from separately from the API that answers it.
//
// **An unclassified operation is named, never assumed.** The predecessor of this
// module (`ghReadSurface`) defaulted everything that was not `gh api <path>` to
// GraphQL, so every `--json` view and listing was labelled GraphQL and the hot
// single-object polls were issued against the pool metered by node points. The
// measured consequence: GraphQL at `0/5000` while REST sat at `4891/5000`, twice
// within one hour. {@link routeGithubArgs} raises instead of guessing.
