// dual-dialect-stream — the ACP socket's byte codec, speaking JSON-RPC 2.0 and
// TOON-RPC 1.0 on one stream.
//
// The ACP SDK's `Stream` is a pair of OBJECT streams: everything above it —
// the connection, the `_redskills/*` methods, compat — never sees wire bytes,
// so the dialect is decided here and nowhere else. The framing and the
// downgrade-safe rules are the resident wire's, reused rather than respelled
// (`@reddb-io/shared/resident-wire.js` owns them, and its tests prove them):
//
// 1. **Every frame is sniffed on its own bytes.** A frame opening with `{` or
//    `[` is one line of JSON (a `[` can only be a JSON-RPC batch); anything
//    else is a TOON document terminated by a blank line. No peer is told,
//    asked, or configured — which is what lets the five external agents keep
//    speaking plain JSON-RPC through the same door.
// 2. **The consumer always sees `jsonrpc: "2.0"` objects.** On the TOON wire
//    the envelope field is `toonrpc: "1.0"` (the TOON-RPC 1.0 spelling of the
//    same JSON-RPC 2.0 semantics); the codec rewrites the envelope at the
//    boundary in both directions, so the SDK stack rides either dialect
//    unmodified. A batch array passes through with each element normalized.
// 3. **Writes answer in kind.** Until the peer has proven a dialect by sending
//    a frame this codec could DECODE, writes use `preferred` — default
//    `"json"`, so shipping this codec changes nothing observable until a peer
//    that WRITES TOON exists. Flipping a single caller's `preferred` later is
//    the whole second slice, gated on porting the resident wire's downgrade
//    proof to this connection shape first.
//
// **Behavioral parity with the SDK's `ndJsonStream` is the contract.** The
// codec is under every ACP socket in the system, so anything it does that
// `ndJsonStream` did not is a regression wearing a feature's name: a malformed
// frame is reported and SKIPPED (never a torn-down connection), the final
// unterminated frame at end of input is flushed, and `cancel` releases the
// socket reader instead of leaking it.
