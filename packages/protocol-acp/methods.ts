// methods — the `_redskills/*` extension surface, named once (ADR 0145 §1).
//
// An extension method is a STRING on a socket, so a literal spelled at the
// server and re-spelled at the client is two independent chances to be wrong,
// and a rename touches whichever copies the renamer happened to grep. The
// registry below is the single spelling; every caller and every handler reads
// its name from here.
//
// What lives here is the WIRE: the method names, their direction, and the
// param shapes that are pure protocol. What a method DOES — admission, budget
// policy, the GitHub gateway, Project control state — stays with the authority
// that owns it, per ADR 0148's body-versus-control cut.
