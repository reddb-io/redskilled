/**
 * dashboard — the richest density: the payload given a vertical dimension.
 *
 * **One implementation, four densities.** The statusline pair settled drift for
 * one line by making the string a pure function of the payload; ADR 0132 decision
 * 1 finishes the argument — four surfaces at four densities cannot share a
 * string, and they must not each own a layout. So the table is drawn HERE, beside
 * the line, from the same selection and the same marks, and a surface prints.
 *
 * **The string is a pure function of the payload.** Nothing here reads a clock, a
 * directory or an environment variable; the elapsed figures are subtracted from
 * the payload's own `generated_at`, so the dashboard and the statusline beside it
 * can only disagree if a pure function is impure.
 *
 * **The pipeline stays a position, never a meaning.** The progress bar is drawn
 * from two integers: the pair a project published (`phase_index`,
 * `phase_total`), or — when it published none — the pair `./lifecycle-phase.js`
 * resolves from the phase word. Neither this module nor that one knows what
 * `coding` or `validating` DO; a declared table says only which of five cells a
 * word sits in, which is presentation, not the castle semantics ADR 0130 rule 3
 * keeps out of the host lane. An undeclared word resolves to nothing and draws
 * no bar, so the renderer can never invent a place in a pipeline it cannot see.
 *
 * **Host-side session facts stay absent rather than faked.** The context window
 * and the Pro/Max 5h/7d usage windows arrive from a Claude Code stdin payload
 * that never reaches the daemon. The header carries the windows the daemon DOES
 * own — the memory ceiling and the Worker slots — and says nothing about the ones
 * it does not, because a plausible zero is worse than a missing column.
