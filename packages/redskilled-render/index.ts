/**
 * @reddb-io/redskilled-render — one render implementation, drawn at parameterized
 * densities.
 *
 * **The no-drift guarantee is one implementation, not one string** (ADR 0132
 * decision 1). ADR 0130 rule 10 had moved rendering into the daemon so that "the
 * string is a pure function of the payload" would keep surfaces from drifting;
 * what that bought was a statusline poorer than the one it replaced, because a
 * single rendered string cannot serve a one-line statusline and a full TUI at
 * once. This module amends the letter of that rule to serve its intent: the
 * layout lives in exactly one place, and each surface asks it for the density it
 * has room for.
 *
 * **Stateless, and it opens no transport.** A pure function from one decoded
 * payload to one drawn surface, so the same module serves a socket read, a piped
 * file and a checked-in fixture — and a fixture payload renders byte-identically
 * to a live one. Nothing here reads a clock, a directory, an environment variable
 * or a file descriptor.
 *
 * **Three densities, composed rather than duplicated.** `line` is the statusline;
 * `panel` is the middle height, whose first row IS the line; `dashboard` is the
 * table. The degradation ladder, the selection and the marks are shared by all
 * three, which is what makes "they cannot drift" rest on code instead of on a
 * shared string.
