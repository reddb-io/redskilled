/**
 * line — the statusline density: one head, then one row per Worker.
 *
 * **The string is a pure function of the payload.** That purity is the whole
 * mitigation for having four surfaces at all (ADR 0132 decision 1): a renderer
 * that could reach for one extra fact — a directory listing, a clock, an
 * environment variable — would be a second authority on a question the payload
 * already answers, and the surfaces would eventually describe different machines.
 * Everything this function needs is an argument, so a fixture payload renders
 * byte-identically to a live one.
 *
 * **The default mode is quiet: only the local project's Workers.** The common
 * case is one operator in one repository, and a line that listed every project
 * by default would make the common case pay for the rare one. `global` lists
 * every project's Workers and names the owner of each, because an anonymous
 * Worker on a busy machine is the exact thing the mode exists to fix.
 *
 * **`verbose` gives each listed Worker a second line: the last line it logged.**
 * That line arrives inside the payload, published by the Worker on its heartbeat,
 * so a verbose global view still costs ONE read and opens no project's files. The
 * renderer treats it as text to fit on a line and never as a fact to interpret:
 * whitespace is collapsed so one Worker cannot break the line contract, and the
 * width clamp is the same one every other line answers to. A Worker that has
 * logged nothing gets no second line at all — a blank one would be a render
 * defect wearing the shape of information.
 *
 * **Width degrades cells, never Workers.** A selected Worker keeps its row at
 * every terminal width; cells leave from the right until the row fits. Count
 * budgets may still choose a project or host aggregate, but width alone never
 * erases the identities the operator came here to see.
