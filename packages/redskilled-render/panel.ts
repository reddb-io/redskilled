/**
 * panel — the middle density: a few rows, for a surface with height and no table.
 *
 * **A panel composes; it does not re-draw.** Its first row IS the statusline
 * line, produced by the line density, and its Worker rows are the dashboard's
 * identity columns without the table. That is the whole point of parameterizing
 * densities instead of shipping three renderers: a status-bar tooltip, a herdr
 * pane header and an editor hover want the same facts at three heights, and the
 * only thing that should differ between them is how many rows they may spend.
 *
 * **It is the density that fits where a table will not.** A `statusLine` entry
 * gets one row; a webview gets a screen; between them sits everything with four
 * to ten — a notification body, a tooltip, a narrow sidebar. Before this existed
 * those surfaces either printed the one-line render and lost the Workers, or
 * printed the dashboard and overflowed.
 *
 * PURE, like every other density: payload and options in, rows out.
