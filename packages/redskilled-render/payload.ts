 * payload — the document this module draws, declared by the reader.
 *
 * **The render is a consumer of a wire document, not of the daemon's internals.**
 * One daemon serves checkouts pinned to different bundle versions (ADR 0130 rule
 * 3), so the shape a surface may rely on is the shape it can still read when the
 * writer is a release ahead or behind. That is why the contract is declared here,
 * on the reading side, and why it names only the fields a layout actually draws:
 * a renderer that demanded the daemon's whole internal record would blank a pane
 * over a field it never prints.
 *
 * **Every block the daemon may not carry is optional, and absence is never zero.**
 * A missing `deaths` block is a daemon that never reaped; an empty one is a
 * reaping that attributed nothing. A missing `metrics` block is a daemon that
 * derives none; a null rate inside one is a window nobody measured. Collapsing
 * either pair is how a broken observer renders as a calm machine.
 *
 * The daemon's own `RedskilledStatuslinePayload` is a superset of this and is
 * assignable to it — `apps/redskilled/tests/render-payload-contract.test.ts` is
 * the ratchet that fails the moment it stops being.
