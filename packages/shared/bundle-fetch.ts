/**
 * bundle-fetch.ts — pure-with-injected-IO resolver for per-plugin built bundles.
 * The installer's exact-version runtime tree answers first; misses fall through
 * to **npm** (ADR 0091, v2 transport cutover; ADR 0146).
 *
 * ADR 0034 originally shipped every plugin bundle as a GitHub Release asset,
 * fetched into a version-keyed cache and verified with a hand-rolled Sigstore
 * signature over a checksum manifest. That channel broke: `cosign sign-blob`
 * emits the legacy cosign bundle format the client's `sigstore-js` verify() no
 * longer accepts ("invalid bundle"), and the self-update lane polled a
 * `releases/download/v1/` release that never existed (eternal 404). There was no
 * working installed base to preserve, so ADR 0091 **deletes** that channel: the
 * bundles now ship inside `@reddb-io/red-skills-<plugin>`, resolved at the exact
 * pinned version via npm's own cache and shasum/provenance integrity. Core keeps
 * the non-plugin companions. No GitHub-release download, no client-side
 * signature verification.
 *
 * This module holds ZERO real IO: every side effect (npm materialisation, file
 * read/write, existence check, registry query) is injected via {@link BundleIO}.
 * The launcher (`entrypoint-cli.ts`) wires these to node built-ins (`npm`,
 * `node:fs`, `fetch`); the test wires them to in-memory fakes. That keeps
 * resolution deterministic and unit-testable with no real network.
