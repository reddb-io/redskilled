/**
 * canonical-invocation — the ONE spelling of "run this binary" (issue #3071).
 *
 * A hint is read at exactly the moment the host is broken, so it must not assume
 * the host is working. `Run \`redskilled provision\`` fails that test twice: the
 * binary is on PATH only where an installer put a shim, and the hint that names
 * it is printed precisely when the daemon that shim would have installed is
 * absent — the instruction points at its own precondition (#2961).
 *
 * The npm direct-run form (ADR 0091) has neither problem: npm is the one
 * transport every host already has, and `-p <pkg>@<version>` pins what runs.
 *
 * **Why a function and not a string per call site.** The launch path, the
 * registration refusal, the provisioning audit and the UI empty states all
 * advise the same repair, and four hand-written spellings drift into four
 * different repairs. One namer means a version the caller knows rides the hint,
 * and a caller that knows nothing still emits a form that works.
