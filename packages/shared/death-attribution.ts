/**
 * death-attribution — the boot reaper that speaks for the deaths nothing watched.
 *
 * **A SIGKILL fires no handler, so the death record it should have written is
 * absent — and that absence is the evidence.** `death-record.ts` guarantees the
 * narrow, total thing: a process that CAN say goodbye always does. This module
 * covers the complement — SIGKILL, machine freeze, power loss — where no trap
 * ran, no parent survived to observe, and the only witness left is the host
 * itself.
 *
 * **A living process leaves an ANCHOR; a dying one takes it with it.** The
 * recorder writes a presence file on install and removes it the moment a record
 * lands, so an anchor still on disk at the next boot means exactly one thing: a
 * process left without saying how. Nothing has to be watching for that to work,
 * which is the whole point — a watcher is precisely what a freeze kills first.
 *
 * **The verdict names its sender class, its confidence and the evidence it used
 * — never a bare guess.** Five classes cover who ended it: `oomd` (the kernel or
 * systemd-oomd reclaimed memory), `user-signal` (a person or tool sent one),
 * `parent-death` (it went down with whatever started it), `teardown` (the host
 * itself stopped under it), and `unknown`. An `unknown` verdict carries the list
 * of everything consulted and what each said, because "we do not know, and here
 * is where we looked" is a finding; an invented cause is a lie that outlives the
 * incident.
 *
 * **Evidence is READ, never inferred from a running process.** Every source is a
 * path — `/proc` walked for real, journal files tailed — so a test poses a host
 * by posing its files, the way WSL2 support was proven, and the code an operator
 * runs is the code under test.
