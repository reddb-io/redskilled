/**
 * death-record — the record a process writes on its own way out.
 *
 * **Nothing that CAN say goodbye is allowed to leave silently.** The 2026-08-01
 * autopsy found that the remaining failures were not lost work but lost REASONS:
 * a dispatch killed twice with nothing on disk naming the signal, a machine
 * freeze that erased the memory of itself. A death nobody recorded is a mystery
 * forever, and repeated mystery is what fragility feels like.
 *
 * **The dying process is the writer, so no watcher is required.** A record that
 * depended on a parent being alive to observe the exit would be absent in exactly
 * the case that matters most — the one where the parent died too. Every trap-able
 * exit therefore writes its own record synchronously, before the process leaves.
 *
 * **One shape, every writer.** A launcher, a worker and the host daemon append the
 * same flat, total record to a lane with the same name (see `red-paths.ts`), so a
 * reader joins deaths across all three without knowing which wrote which.
 *
 * **Un-trap-able deaths are NOT this module's job.** SIGKILL fires no handler and
 * no `exit` event, so a SIGKILLed process leaves no record here — its absence is
 * the signal a later reaper attributes from kernel and journal evidence. What
 * this module guarantees is narrower and total: a process that CAN say goodbye
 * always does.
 *
 * TOONL on disk through the TOON encoder (repo mandate), written with the
 * SYNCHRONOUS file API because an `exit` handler cannot await — a promise still
 * in flight when the process leaves is the very silence the record exists to
 * break.
