/**
 * land-countersign — the one question every land entry point asks before it merges.
 *
 * ADR 0154's land precondition is a single sentence: **no land without a
 * non-voided passing Countersign matching the head actually being merged.** ADR
 * 0156 is what makes that sentence sayable: `Verdict` stays the gate's failure
 * classifier of ADR 0136, and the second signature gets its own word. The
 * sentence is easy; the failure mode is that there is no single place that says
 * it. A merge happens in five places — the AFK lifecycle landing, the merge
 * driver, the land tool, the ACP land method, and reconcile/adopt-branch — and
 * they sit in four different layers. A rule each of them spells for itself is a
 * rule four of them will eventually spell differently.
 *
 * So the VOCABULARY lives here, in the lowest layer everything can reach: the
 * refusal reasons, the subject a gate is asked about, the decision it answers
 * with, and the port through which an entry point asks. The ledger-backed
 * implementation cannot live here — the Countersign lane is runtime state and this
 * package may reach nothing above it — so it stays in the runtime layer and
 * arrives as {@link LandCountersignGate}. That split is deliberate: the engine and
 * the daemon get the question without inheriting the store.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO "unknown" or "skip" outcome. A gate that cannot
 * answer refuses, because the whole point of ADR 0154 is that an absence of
 * judgement stopped being indistinguishable from a passing one.
