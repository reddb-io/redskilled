/**
 * project-identity-resolve.ts — the ONE place a directory becomes a project label.
 *
 * `project-identity.ts` holds the DECISION and stays pure: it reads no file, no
 * environment and no git process, so the rule "declared, else the remote's
 * `owner/repo`, else the checkout basename" is testable as a table. This module
 * is the collection half — the git calls and the config read that feed it.
 *
 * **The two halves are separate files; the label has ONE authority.** They were
 * separate functions in two apps before #2928, and the drift was invisible until
 * it mattered: the birth path resolved a label through the full order while the
 * statusline read only the declared name, so a repository that declared none
 * asked the daemon about a project the daemon had never heard of and read back an
 * idle zero from a host holding three of its Workers. A second resolver is not a
 * second implementation of a rule — it is a second answer to "where am I".
 *
 * **A git call that fails contributes nothing rather than aborting.** A checkout
 * with no git, no remote and no declared name still resolves to a stable label:
 * an unlabelled Worker is worse than one labelled by its directory, and a
 * statusline that threw because `git` was missing would be a blank line.
