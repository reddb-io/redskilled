/**
 * project-identity.ts — one identity per project, resolved once (Spec #2772).
 *
 * A project has two names and they are not the same thing:
 *   - `name` is what a human reads. It resolves from a declared `project.name`,
 *     then the git remote's `owner/repo`, then the checkout basename.
 *   - `slug` is what the filesystem uses. It is the slugified name plus a short
 *     hash of the absolute git common directory, ALWAYS present.
 *
 * The hash is unconditional on purpose. Detecting a collision first is racy —
 * two clients may not see each other's directories at the same instant, so a
 * collision-only suffix fails in exactly the case it exists for.
 *
 * Hashing the git *common* directory rather than the checkout has a second
 * effect that is wanted, not incidental: every worktree of a repository collapses
 * onto the project its main checkout owns, which is the correct owner for a
 * Worker running inside one.
 *
 * A generated `project.id` written back into config was considered and rejected:
 * the config file is versioned, so a clone would inherit the id and recreate the
 * very collision it was meant to prevent.
 *
 * The resolver is PURE over its inputs — it reads no filesystem, no environment
 * and no git process. Callers collect `remoteUrl` and `gitCommonDir` and hand
 * them in, so the decision itself stays testable as a table.
 */

 * The sanctioned root-level config key holding the declared display name.

 * dev, memory and brain plugins in one repository, so it belongs to none of
 * them. Because the loader treats an unsanctioned root key as off-contract, the
 * sanction is explicit — see `SANCTIONED_ROOT_CONFIG_KEYS` in
