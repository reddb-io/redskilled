/**
 * worker-workspace.ts — where a Worker's worktree, log and state live (Spec #2772).
 *
 * The location is a DECLARED CHOICE FROM A CLOSED SET, not a free path. Three
 * presets plus a free-form parent directory:
 *
 *   - `local` (the default) — `<repo>/.red/tmp/workers/…`, flat, with the
 *     worktree as its direct child. It needs no per-repository segmentation
 *     because it is already inside the repository.
 *   - `tmp`  — `/tmp/.redskilled/repositories/<slug>/workers/…`
 *   - `host` — `~/.red/redskilled/repositories/<slug>/workers/…`, under the
 *     daemon's own home, which `redskilled` owns and creates (ADR 0130
 *     Amendment 2). This module names that root, it never brings it into being.
 *
 * The two shared presets segment by repository under the deterministic slug from
 * `project-identity.ts`, so the whole machine lists with one directory listing.
 * A free-form value names the PARENT DIRECTORY OF WORKERS, never the Worker
 * directory itself.
 *
 * A closed set rather than a free path is the house pattern: ADR 0098 requires
 * every writer to use a named lane and forbids loose files under the tmp tier,
 * and a lane NAME is also what a statusline can show without rendering a whole
 * path. An unknown preset is therefore a config error, never a silent fallback —
 * a silent fallback would place Workers somewhere the operator did not choose
 * and never say so.
 *
 * ── The refusal is load-bearing ──
 *
 * A target on a MEMORY-BACKED filesystem is refused outright. A worktree plus
 * its installed dependencies held in RAM would consume the very budget the
 * daemon exists to protect, so the daemon would be financing the incident it was
 * built to prevent. A target subject to AUTOMATIC CLEANUP is refused for a
 * blunter reason: it would delete a live Worker's worktree.
 *
 * Refused, not warned about — a warning about a target the operator has already
 * declared is a message nobody reads until the incident it predicted.
 *
 * The decision layer is PURE. It reads no filesystem, no environment and no
 * process: the caller collects FACTS about the target (`/proc/mounts`, the
 * host's `tmpfiles.d` config) and hands them in, so both the layout and the
 * refusal stay testable as tables. The parsers for those facts live here too and
 * are equally pure — they take the declaring TEXT, not a path to read.
