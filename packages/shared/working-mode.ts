// working-mode — the four ways work enters RedSkills, and the marker a Worker
// exports so a skill can tell which one it is running inside (ADR 0150 §1–§2).
//
// The vocabulary was already written down once, as a guard over shipped skill
// headers (`apps/plugin-dev/src/core/working-mode-guard.ts`). It lives HERE now because
// a second reader needs it: the daemon, which exports the marker. Two hand-kept
// copies of a four-value closed set is the shape a fifth value gets added to one
// of them, and the marker a Worker exports must be the SAME string a skill
// header declares — otherwise a skill comparing the two never matches and the
// refusal ADR 0150 §2 asks for silently never fires.
//
// **Only two of the four modes are a Worker's.** Interactive and ADR-editing
// work happens in a human's checkout, where nobody exports anything; spec-driven
// and ad-hoc work is coordinated by `redskilled`, whose Workers run in OS
// temporary storage (ADR 0149) with no human attached. So the marker's absence
// is meaningful too — it says "not inside a Worker" — and this module never
// invents a value for a process that has none.
