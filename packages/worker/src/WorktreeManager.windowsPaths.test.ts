/**
 * Unit tests for the slash-normalization that lets WorktreeManager compare
 * paths from two sources with different conventions:
 *
 *   - `git worktree list --porcelain` emits forward-slash paths on every
 *     platform (e.g. "C:/dev/repo/.red-castle/worktrees/foo").
 *   - `path.join` on Windows emits backslash paths
 *     (e.g. "C:\\dev\\repo\\.red-castle\\worktrees\\foo").
 *
 * Without `toPosix`, the `===`, `.startsWith()`, and Set lookups inside
 * `create` (collision detection / managed-worktree reuse) and `pruneStale`
 * (active-worktree set) mismatch on Windows. Effects:
 *
 *   - `pruneStale` wipes active worktrees out from under running sandboxes,
 *     because they appear orphaned to the Set lookup.
 *   - `create` cannot reuse a managed worktree (clean or dirty / mid-rebase),
 *     because the prefix check fails and it falls through to the
 *     external-collision error path.
 *
 * These tests run identically on Windows and POSIX hosts — they exercise the
 * comparison logic with literal mixed-slash inputs rather than relying on the
 * host's `path` implementation. The end-to-end integration tests in
 * `WorktreeManager.test.ts` only exhibit the bug on Windows (where
 * `path.join` actually produces backslashes), so this file is what gives
 * Linux CI sensitivity to the fix.
