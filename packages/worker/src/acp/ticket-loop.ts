/**
 * The Ticket loop: claim → implement → gate → re-seed → publish → land, run
 * INSIDE the Worker process (issue #4020, ADR 0148, ADR 0129, ADR 0135).
 *
 * The dev bundle used to hold this arc, which meant the daemon could see a
 * Worker's birth and its death and nothing in between. ADR 0148 moved the body
 * here, so the arc moved with it — and the seam it crosses moved with the arc:
 * every write leaves as an ACP REQUEST to the parent. The Worker never holds a
 * credential, never pushes, never opens a pull request; it names the branch and
 * the commit its work produced and asks (ADR 0144 §3).
 *
 * **The loop re-seeds; it never re-queues.** A blocked gate re-instructs the
 * SAME implementer in the SAME Worktree on the SAME branch, carrying forward
 * what is already committed, because the alternative — a fresh Worker on a
 * clean checkout — pays for the work twice (ADR 0129). The budget is what stops
 * that from becoming an eternal poll: when the rounds are spent the loop stops
 * with the gate's own verdict rather than trying once more.
 *
 * **Nothing is published for work the gate refused.** Publish and land are the
 * last two stages precisely so that the gate stands between the implementer and
 * the remote. A Worker whose gate blocked returns `gate-blocked` and hands the
 * branch to nobody.
