// gate-stage-order — the gate's stages in CHEAP → EXPENSIVE order, and the fold
// that turns their outcomes into ONE verdict (ADR 0119, issue #2245).
//
// The order used to live beside the dev bundle's escalation sink, which was
// fine while the dev bundle was the only body that ran a gate. It is not any
// more: `redskilled acp-worker` runs the declared stages LOCALLY, inside the
// Worker process, before it asks the daemon to publish (issue #4020, ADR 0148).
// Restating the order there would be two tables that agree only until someone
// edits one, so the order moved down here — to the package both bodies embed —
// and `apps/plugin-dev/src/core/shared-gate.ts` re-exports it for its own callers.
//
// **The order is the contract, not the evaluation sequence.** A caller may
// evaluate stages in whatever sequence its plumbing makes convenient and may
// hand over only the stages it has run so far; the fold always names the
// EARLIEST blocker, so "which stage decided this" never depends on the order
// somebody happened to loop in.
