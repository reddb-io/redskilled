//
// A `lane:scout` issue is a READ-ONLY investigation: `run_mode=scout` is what
// makes the Ticket loop skip push, gate and landing. That mode once arrived only
// through the `/go --scout` dispatch argv, so every OTHER entrance — a plain
// `--issues N` run, a `--lane lane:scout` drain, any future caller — picked the
// same issue up modeless and would have committed against it (observed live
// 2026-08-01). The lane was isolated at SELECTION; the mode was not enforced at
// the CLAIM, so the two agreed only by the argv of one caller.
//
// **The contract lives beside the lane set it is pinned against.** The isolated
// lanes are `DEFAULT_CASTLE_SELECTION_LABELS.laneIsolated` in `worker-drain.ts`,
// one module over, and both Worker bodies now need the pair: the dev bundle
// enforces it in `process-issue/lifecycle.ts` and `redskilled acp-worker`
// enforces it in its Ticket loop (ADR 0148). Enforcing it where the Ticket is
// CLAIMED — not in a dispatcher — means every entrance inherits it, including
// the ones not written yet.
