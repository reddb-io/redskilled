// dashboard string: the 48h sparkline header line (reused from history.ts,
// NOT reimplemented) followed by one line per worker.
//
// The render is PURE — no clock, no filesystem, no ANSI. The caller injects the
// already-read state objects, the per-worker diff string (the
// worktree_diff_stats output), the liveness flag (state_is_live), and `now`.
// ANSI colouring and the TTY box-drawing `render_full` mode are out of scope:
// the agent-rendering contract (see monitor.sh's render_compact heredoc) maps
// the plain tags to colour downstream, and the TTY refresh loop belongs to the
// orchestration-loop slice.
