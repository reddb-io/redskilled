// state-transition.ts — the single owner of issue state-label mutations
// (red-skills ADR 0122 rule 5, Spec #2523, slices #2524 + #2661 + #2666).
//
// An issue carries exactly ONE state role at any time. On 2026-07-22 three
// issues accumulated contradictory role sets (park labels stacked on the
// executable-queue label, an active blocker on a queued issue) because every
// code path wrote labels directly; each contradiction became a red boot probe
// and froze the fleet. This module makes those sets unconstructible: callers
// declare the TRANSITION they want, the planner computes the atomic add/remove
// set, refuses any request that would leave zero or two state roles, and the
// apply step performs the whole mutation as ONE tracker call.
//
// The engine owns no label spellings. Every caller injects its
// {@link StateTransitionLabels} vocabulary — the redskilled MCP resident wires
// `readEngineLabelVocabulary()`, the red-skills host wires its own
// `triage-labels.ts` constants through the `core/state-transition.ts` shim.

 * value-imports a host's label constants; the construction site supplies them.
