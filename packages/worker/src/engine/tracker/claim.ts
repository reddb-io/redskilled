// Atomic GitHub-native claim substrate (ADR 0066, issue #622, PRD #614) —
// unified single implementation (red-skills boundary consolidation).
//
// This module is the ONE owner of the claim wire format. The battle-proven
// implementation absorbed here previously lived in the consuming host
// (`apps/plugin-dev/src/core/claim.ts`, now a re-export shim); the earlier
// tracker-local twin (`renderTrackerClaimComment`/`parseTrackerClaimRecords`/
// `reconcileTrackerClaims`) is deleted — it had no production callers and
// predated the #2385 fail-loud hardening. The castle-only local FS lease layer
// (`createFsIssueLeaseStore`, `acquireIssueLease`, `retireIssueLease`) is
// retained and rebuilt on the absorbed core.
//
// Replaces the racy three-layer label claim (host-local mkdir lock → `running`
// label pre-check → label edit) with a GitHub-native primitive any claimant on
// any host can use: local fleet workers, other users' fleets, and GitHub Actions
// runners. The chosen ordered primitive is **structured claim-comment ordering**:
// every claimant posts a structured `<!-- afk:claim … -->` marker comment; GitHub
// assigns each comment a globally monotonic, server-side `id`, which is the total
// order across all hosts. The earliest active claim wins. See ADR 0066 for the
// rejected alternatives (assignee CAS, check-run).
//
// Structure — three layers, the diff one pure:
//
//   marker      renderClaimComment(self) / parseClaimRecords(comments) — the wire
//     format. parseClaimRecords is garbage-tolerant: any comment that is not a
//     well-formed afk:claim marker is silently skipped, so arbitrary issue chatter
//     (and malformed/forged markers) never corrupts the decision.
//
//   reconciler  reconcileClaim(records, self, opts) — PURE. Given the parsed claim
//     records plus the claimant's own identity + comment id, returns won | lost
//     and the winner. No I/O. Liveness/staleness is injected via opts.isStale,
//     so cross-host stale-claim recovery stays a pure function of injected facts.
//
//   orchestrator  acquireClaim(gh, self, issue, opts) — the thin impure shell with
//     the GitHub client injected: post our claim → list claim markers → reconcile →
//     concede (best-effort) if we lost. The verdict is computed by the pure layer;
//     this layer only performs the side effects.
//
// Labels (`running` etc.) are no longer the lock. They remain an observability
// PROJECTION applied best-effort by the caller and are never consulted to
// arbitrate a winner.
