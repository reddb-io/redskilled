# scripts/install-git-hooks.sh — install the repo-tracked git hooks in
# scripts/git-hooks/ into the local .git/hooks/ dir.
#
# Idempotent — safe to re-run. Existing hooks of the same name are OVERWRITTEN
# (the tracked copy is the source of truth; if you have a local customisation,
# edit scripts/git-hooks/<name> and re-run this).
#
# Why this exists: AFK worker worktrees need workspace dependencies before
# local validation can run. Tracking the hook in the repo + shipping an
# installer means a fresh clone (or a contributor's first pull) gets the right
# shape immediately, no manual hook copying required.
