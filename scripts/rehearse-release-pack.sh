# red-publish.yml builds every bundle, stages the per-plugin and core npm
# packages, packs them, checks the tarball boundaries, publishes, and only then
# does anyone install what came out. Four latent faults
# rode that gap into v3.19.0..v3.19.2 (a release-engine bundle nothing built, a
# runtime bundle demanded from a skills-only plugin, scripts that lost their
# executable bit in the tarball, and per-plugin packages that were a skills
# excerpt the OpenCode generator could not consume). Each one cost a burnt
# release to discover, because the pull-request checks drive fakes: a fake
# cosign, fixture tarballs, a fake npm.
#
# This script runs the real producer chain and the real consumer, hermetically:
#   1. build every runtime bundle the way the publish job does;
#   2. stage and pack the per-plugin packages and the core package at a
#      rehearsal version;
#   3. run the tarball boundary check the publish runs;
#   4. compose the tarballs into a host-installable tree through an npm shim,
#      then wire a fake OpenCode host through scripts/install.sh --local-dev
#      into a throwaway XDG_CONFIG_HOME;
#   5. assert the host surface the generator wrote is complete.
#
# It leaves the checkout as it found it: packaging/ is regenerated with a
# rehearsal version and restored from git afterwards, so it refuses to start
# on a dirty packaging/ tree rather than lose someone's work.
#
