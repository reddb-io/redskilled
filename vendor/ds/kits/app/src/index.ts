// The application Kit's public surface.
//
// A Kit is the unit of export routing (ADR 0002): a Product Application
// receives this directory as vendorable source and imports from here. What it
// ships comes in the Taxonomy's two halves
// (.red/contexts/component-system/CONTEXT.md): a Primitive
// imports no other Kit component, and a Composite composes at least one. Both
// are mechanical properties, read off the imports by `test/taxonomy.test.ts`
// rather than decided by anyone.
//
// Each component is exported alongside its `tv()` variants object, because the
// classes are as much of the contract as the element is: a consumer that needs
// a link to look like a Button imports `button` and puts the classes on its
// own <a>, instead of forking the component to change one tag.
//
// Every export below is a named one, and nothing here has a side effect, so a
// bundler keeps only what an application actually imported — the property ADR
// 0005 asks of the Composites' behavior base, pinned by
// `test/tree-shaking.test.ts` against a real build's output.
