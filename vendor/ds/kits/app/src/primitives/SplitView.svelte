<!--
  SplitView — a Primitive: it imports no other Kit component. It imports its
  own behavior module, which is a `.ts` file and not a component, so the
  mechanical test in test/taxonomy.test.ts reads it as what it is.

  Two panes and a divider you can move, by pointer or by keyboard. The
  arithmetic lives in split-view.behavior.ts, where it can be tested without a
  browser; what is left here is the part that genuinely needs a DOM.

  The divider is a real `role="separator"` with a tab stop and value bounds, so
  the split is adjustable without a pointer at all — the failure mode of every
  hand-rolled splitter, and the reason this one is in the Kit rather than in
  each application.

  `fraction` is bindable: an application that wants to persist the split reads
  it, and one that does not can ignore it entirely.

  <!-- A focusable separator is the ARIA window splitter: interactive by role,
