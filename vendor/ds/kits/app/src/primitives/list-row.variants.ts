// that must truncate rather than wrap, and a trailing rail pushed to the end.
// Those four have to agree about height and gap, so one `density` moves them
// together.
//
// `interactive` is not a caller's choice — the component sets it from whether
// the row actually does anything (see ListRow.svelte). A row that looks
// pressable and is not is the lie this axis exists to prevent, so it cannot be
// set independently of the element that carries the behavior.

// wearing one word, and they compose rather than compete: the row's axis picks
// WHICH spatial role each slot wears, and the document's stop decides what

// compact row, laid out spaciously — which is the arrangement a dense table
// inside a marketing page actually wants (ADR 0003).
