// NavItem's styling. See button.variants.ts for the split, the colour rule and
// the spatial rule.
//
// The active state is drawn with a tinted surface and a full-weight foreground
// rather than with an accent bar down one side: a side bar is a per-side
// border width, and the Brand ships no token family for widths — so the bar
// would be a value the Themes cannot reach, in the one component whose whole
// job is to show where you are.
//
// Opacity is doing the work an extra surface token would otherwise do, which
// is the same choice button.variants.ts made and for the same reason: the
// Tokens Layer ships no second surface yet.
