// NodeBadge's styling. See button.variants.ts for the split, the colour rule
// and the spatial rule — under which the dot keeps its own size, because it is
// a mark read at a glance rather than a space between things.
//
// Four statuses and two Theme-declared colours to tell them apart with, so
// colour is deliberately not the whole signal: each status is a pair — which
// token the dot is drawn in, and whether it is filled or hollow. `online` and
// `degraded` share the primary token and differ in fill; `offline` and
// `unknown` share the muted one. Two axes out of one colour family, and a
// Theme can move both without the statuses collapsing into each other.
//
// The status word itself is always in the DOM (see NodeBadge.svelte), which is
// what makes that arrangement safe rather than clever: nothing here is the
// only carrier of the meaning.
