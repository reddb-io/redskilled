// Pill's styling. See button.variants.ts for the split, the colour rule and the
// spatial rule — under which only the medium size's inset lands on a role the
// axis ships. The small size is a notch below the narrowest one, and a value
// the axis has no role for stays a step rather than being pushed onto the
// nearest, which would move what the neutral stop renders.
//
// A Pill is round-ended (`rounded-full`) and stands on its own: a filter that
// is on, a tag, a selected facet. That is why it — unlike Badge — has a size
// axis and a dismissible affordance.
