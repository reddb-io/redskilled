// The anti-hardcode lint, asked of THIS Kit.
//
// The rule and its counter-examples live with the linter
// (packages/kit-lint/test/lint.test.ts), because they are facts about the rule.
// What is a fact about the application Kit is only this: every file it ships is
// clean, and the command CI runs says so with a zero exit code.
//
// This file IS acceptance criterion 2 of issue #7 ("each component's styling
// resolves through Theme/Tokens variables — the anti-hardcode lint passes on
// the Kit"), in the same way packages/theme/test/lint.test.ts is the Theme
// Layer's.
