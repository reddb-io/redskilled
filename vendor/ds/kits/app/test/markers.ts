// What a marker has to be, written as functions instead of assertions.
//
// `tree-shaking.test.ts` attributes a bundle by looking in it for class
// strings the Kits' components write. That reading — "the marker is here, so
// the component is here" — only holds while two properties do:
//
//   coverage        every catalogued component has a marker, or the bundle
//                   assertions quietly stop measuring the ones that do not;
//   distinctiveness no marker can be written by a second component, or a hit
//                   attributes the bundle to the wrong one.
//
// Both used to be asserted inline in that file and neither was itself tested,
// which is how coverage drifted the moment Diff landed (#158) and stayed
// drifted until the two lists were compared by eye. They live here so
// `markers.test.ts` can hold them against a fixture catalogue built to break
// them: a guard nothing exercises is a guard nobody knows the shape of.
