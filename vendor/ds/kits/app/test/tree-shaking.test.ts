// What a bundler keeps, read off a real build.
//
// Issue #48's second acceptance criterion, and a promise ADR 0005 made when it
// took Bits UI as the Composites' behavior base: "per-primitive importable so
// tree-shaking keeps only what a page uses". A promise like that is untestable
// by inspection — every module here looks importable — so this file makes it a
// measurement instead: two entry files, each importing one component through
// a real package subpath, are put through Vite's real production build, and
// what is asserted is the text of the output.
//
// Two directions, because either alone would be easy to satisfy by accident:
//
//   the menu's bundle   must carry the inherited Base Composite, the Button it
//                       composes, and the one Bits primitive it uses — and
//                       nothing else from either Kit or Bits;
//   the Button's bundle must carry no behavior base at all, which is what
//                       keeps a marketing page that imports one control from
//                       paying for a menu system it never renders.
//
// The markers are class strings the components write, one per component, and
// each is checked — against both Kits' whole shipped source, not just the
// modules catalogued below — to be written by exactly the component it names
// before it is used, so a marker that stopped being distinctive fails here
// rather than quietly making an assertion vacuous. That check reads source
// text because these builds are unminified: a class literal reaches the output
// verbatim, which is what makes `bundle.includes(marker)` readable at all.
//
// This is also what `"sideEffects": false` in the Kit's package.json is for.
// A Svelte component compiles to module-level code a bundler must assume is
// side-effecting unless the package says otherwise; without that field every
// Primitive in the barrel survives into every bundle, which is the state this
// file was written against and the reason the field exists.
