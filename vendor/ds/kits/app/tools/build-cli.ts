// Build command for the application Kit.
//
//   pnpm --filter kit-app build
//
// A Kit's artifact is its source: components are distributed as vendorable
// Svelte 5 source (ADR 0002), not as a compiled bundle, so "building" is
// staging exactly what a consumer receives into dist/ — the directory the
// release bundler collects from every package and Kit
// (scripts/producer/src/collect.ts).
//
// Unlike the Layers' artifacts, this dist is a verbatim copy of committed
// source and carries no information of its own, so it is generated on demand
// and git-ignored rather than committed. Copying in sorted order with the
// file list printed keeps the same commit producing the same bundle, which is
// what the release reproducibility check depends on.
