// The Marks the Logo may place, and the refusal when it may not.

// The Brand owns the drawing; the DS owns only the placement (ADR 0004). So
// this module enumerates what the pinned Assets release ships and nothing
// else: five layouts, two surfaces, and one hole where the release ships no
// Mark. It never composes, recolors or substitutes a Mark — the asset licence
// binds that literally, and a variant that does not exist upstream is a Brand
// proposal, not a local file.
//
// A Mark is reached by importing the file, so it stays opaque bytes the whole
// way through: the bundler emits the SVG as an asset and hands back its URL,
// which is what the Logo renders as an <img>. Nothing here parses the drawing,
// and no code path can alter it — "reproduced unaltered" is therefore a
// property of how the Logo works rather than a rule someone has to follow.
//
// `on` names the SURFACE behind the Mark, never the Theme: a dark hero on a
// light marketing page takes `on="dark"` under the light Color Scheme, which is
// exactly the case ADR 0004 fixed the prop for.
