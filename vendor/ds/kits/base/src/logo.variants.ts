// The Logo's styling, and nothing else.

// Every class the component wears lives here, in one `tv()` call, by the same
// convention the application Kit follows: the component file holds behavior
// only, and the anti-hardcode lint has a single place to read a component's
// whole visual vocabulary.
//
// There is very little to say, and that is the point. The Logo shows a Brand
// drawing the DS may not recolor (ADR 0004), so it names no colour for the
// Mark at all — the one colour here is the focus ring's, which belongs to the
// application's surface and not to the Brand's drawing, and is named through
// the Theme Layer's utility like every other colour in a Kit.
//
// Mark geometry remains absent: clearspace and size are arithmetic on the
// caller's `size` (logo.box.ts), lengths no Theme or Density stop may reassign.
// Density instead owns the separation outside that licensed box, so a compact
// masthead and a spacious one can place the same unmodified Logo honestly.
