// The anti-hardcode lint, asked of the Base Kit.
//
// Issue #47's third acceptance criterion. The rule and its counter-examples
// live with the linter (packages/kit-lint), because they are facts about the
// rule; what is a fact about this Kit is that every file it ships is clean and
// that the command CI runs says so with a zero exit code.
//
// The Kit's README promised the rule would arrive here by extraction rather
// than by copy, so this suite also pins the extraction itself: the Base Kit's
// linter IS the application Kit's, reached through the shared package.
