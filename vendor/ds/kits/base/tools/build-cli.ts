// A Kit's artifact is its source (ADR 0002), so "building" is staging exactly
// what a consumer receives into dist/ — the directory the release bundler
// collects from every package and Kit (scripts/producer/src/collect.ts). Same
// shape as the application Kit's build, for the same reason: the release
// bundle must be reproducible from a commit, so the copy is made in sorted
// order and the file list is printed.
